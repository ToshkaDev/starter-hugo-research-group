<!--StartFragment-->

I am a recent graduate of Ohio State in Molecular Genetics looking to pursue a PhD in the near future. My work in Jouline lab is focused on the evolution of serine-threonine kinases (Pkinases). In particular, I am interested in the presence and distribution of STKs in prokaryotes. In addition to biology I have an interest and education in computer science.
