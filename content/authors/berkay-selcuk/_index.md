I am interested in understanding the evolution of G protein-coupled receptors. My previous work was focused on residues that are conserved in aminergic receptors that may control G protein coupling selectivity and receptor homodimerization. Currently, I am building the phylogenetic tree for all human GPCRs to understand how evolution impacts receptor functions.
