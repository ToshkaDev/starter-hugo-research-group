    <p>I study protein structure and evolution using computational methods, including clustering algorithms, biological networks, phylogenetic analyses, molecular docking, etc. My current research topic focuses on the most common sensor, Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains, in signal transduction systems. With a background in biology and an interest in computer science, I'm passionate about combining them together to better understand the secrets of life sciences.</p>
