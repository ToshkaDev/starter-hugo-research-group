    <p>
      My research is focused on the analysis of the diversity and evolution of two-component signal transduction systems in eukaryotes and chemosensory systems in prokaryotes. Another line of research that I am also pursuing is using evolutionary genomics to improve the prediction of the outcome of missense mutations in human genes.
