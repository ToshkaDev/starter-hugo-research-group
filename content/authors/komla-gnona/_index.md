  <div class="row person-info">
    <p>I am broadly interested in statistical genetics, particularly in improving methods used for understanding the genetic basis of human diseases. Recently, I have been working on identifying and prioritizing the effect of genetic variants implicated in diseases such as epilepsy and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. I have a BS in mathematics from The Ohio State University and currently working on my PhD in the Biophysics department. Outside of the lab, I am a soccer player and an avid runner.</p>
