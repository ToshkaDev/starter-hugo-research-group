    <p>My research interests include signal transduction pathways in commensal gut bacteria and biofuel production. I also have a passion for antibiotic resistance research. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a Clinical Microbiologist. My hobbies include rock climbing, hiking, reading, and gaming. I hope to enter the biofuel research industry after completing my degree.</p>
