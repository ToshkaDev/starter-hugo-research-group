    <p>I am interested in understanding the evolutionary processes that shape life on Earth. My current research encompasses two directions: finding ligand binding determinants of extracellular receptors and developing a comprehensive picture of signal transduction in prokaryotes.</p> 
    <p>
    In our recent study I have discovered an amino acid binding motif found in various receptors across the Tree of Life. In humans this receptor is a constituent of alpha2/delta regulatory subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels and is implicated in various neurological disorders (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2110415119" target="_blank">paper</a>). To make my own research and the research of others more efficient I have contributed to the latest release of the Microbial Signal Transduction databas, <a href="https://mistdb.com/" target="_blank">MiST</a>, which includes more than 125,000 genomes, and developed a computational platform for protein evolution and function analysis, <a href="http://trend.evobionet.com/" target="_blank">TREND</a>. </p>
