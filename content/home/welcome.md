### **Nature has already performed billions of genetic experiments; we just need to analyze the resultsâ€¦**

We are interested in understanding how living cells detect and transmit signals. Signal transduction is critical for regulating complex behaviors, such as navigation, memory, and development. We apply computational approaches to reveal novel features that cannot be found by using experimental techniques alone. We aim at understanding fundamental mechanisms, but our work also has medical implications, because aberrant signaling in human cells leads to many diseases including cancer and signaling pathways in both bacteria and humans are targets for drug design.
