## **Nature has already performed billions of genetic experiments; we just need to analyze the resultsâ€¦**

We are interested in understanding how cells detect and transmit signals. Signal transduction systems control complex behaviors, such as motility. We develop computational evolutionary approaches to reveal novel features of signal transduction. We aim at understanding fundamental mechanisms, but our work also has medical implications, because aberrant signaling in human cells leads to diseases, and signaling pathways in both bacteria and humans are targets for drug design.
