## **Nature has already performed billions of genetic experiments - our task is to analyze the resultsâ€¦**

We study how bacteria detect and respond to signals from their environment and from within the cell. Bacterial signaling networks regulate behaviors as diverse as motility, development, metabolic adaptation, and virulence. We investigate how these systems emerged, diversified, and adapted to different ecological niches. Our goals range from uncovering universal design principles of signal transduction to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of signal detection and transmission. Beyond advancing fundamental microbiology, our findings inform strategies for targeting bacterial and human pathways in medicine.
