## **Nature has already performed billions of genetic experiments - we simply need to analyze the resultsâ€¦**

We are interested in understanding how cells detect and transmit signals. Signal transduction systems control complex behaviors, such as motility. To uncover novel features of these systems, we develop computational approaches grounded in evolutionary genomics. Our goal is to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of cellular signaling. At the same time, our research has important biomedical implications, as dysregulated signaling underlies many human diseases, and signal transduction pathways in both bacterial and human cells serve as valuable targets for drug development.
