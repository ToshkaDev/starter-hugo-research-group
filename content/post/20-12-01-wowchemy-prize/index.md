The wait is over – MiST3.0 has just been launched!

The database is still under a heavy development, so please be patient – some genomes are still being processed, but all reference and representative RefSeq genomes are available for exploration.

Please, send us your comments and report issues.

Many thanks to Luke Ulrich and Vadim Gumerov for the final push and to Davi Ortega and Ogun Adebali for their contributions.
