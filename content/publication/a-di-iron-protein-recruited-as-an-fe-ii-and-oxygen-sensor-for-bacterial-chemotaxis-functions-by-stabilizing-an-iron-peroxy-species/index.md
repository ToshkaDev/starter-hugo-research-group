abstract: Many bacteria contain cytoplasmic chemoreceptors that lack sensor
  domains. Here, we demonstrate that such cytoplasmic receptors found in 8
  different bacterial and archaeal phyla genetically couple to metalloproteins
  related to β-lactamases and nitric oxide reductases. We show that this
  oxygen-binding di-iron protein (ODP) acts as a sensor for chemotactic
  responses to both iron and oxygen in the human pathogen Treponema denticola
  (Td). The ODP di-iron site binds oxygen at high affinity to reversibly form an
  unusually stable μ-peroxo adduct. Crystal structures of ODP from Td and the
  thermophile Thermotoga maritima (Tm) in the Fe[III]2-O22−, Zn[II], and apo
  states display differences in subunit association, conformation, and metal
  coordination that indicate potential mechanisms for sensing. In reconstituted
  systems, iron-peroxo ODP destabilizes the phosphorylated form of the
  receptor-coupled histidine kinase CheA, thereby providing a biochemical link
  between oxygen sensing and chemotaxis in diverse prokaryotes, including
  anaerobes of ancient origin.
