abstract: Azospirillum brasilense shows chemotaxis to a variety of nutrients and
  oxygen. Genes encoding the central signal transduction pathway in chemotaxis
  were identified by phenotypic complementation of generally non-chemotactic
  mutants. Sequencing of a DNA fragment, which complemented two different
  mutants, revealed a region of five open reading frames translated in one
  direction and encoding homologs of known genes comprising excitation and
  adaptation pathways for chemotaxis in other bacterial species. The major
  chemotaxis gene cluster appears to be essential for all known behavioral
  responses that direct swimming motility in A. brasilense. Phylogenetic and
  genomic analysis revealed three groups of chemotaxis operons in
  α-proteobacterial species and assigned the A. brasilense operon to one of
  them. Interestingly, operons that are shown to be major regulators of behavior
  in several α-proteobacterial species are not orthologous.
