abstract: Chemoreceptors provide sensory specificity and sensitivity that enable
  motile bacteria to seek optimal positions for growth and metabolism in
  gradients of various physicochemical cues. Despite the abundance of
  chemoreceptors, little is known regarding the sensory specificity and the
  exact contribution of individual chemoreceptors to the lifestyle of bacteria.
  Azospirillum brasilense are motile bacteria that can fix atmospheric nitrogen
  under microaerophilic conditions. Here, we characterized a chemoreceptor in
  this organism, named AerC, which functions as a redox sensor that enables the
  cells to seek microaerophilic conditions that support optimum nitrogen
  fixation. AerC is a representative of a widespread class of soluble
  chemoreceptors that monitor changes in the redox status of the electron
  transport system via the FAD cofactor associated with its PAS domains. In A.
  brasilense, AerC clusters at the cell poles. Its cellular localization and
  contribution to the behavioral response correlate with its expression pattern
  and with changes in the overall cellular FAD content under nitrogen-fixing
  conditions. AerC-mediated energy taxis in A. brasilense prevails under
  conditions of nitrogen fixation, illustrating a strategy by which cells
  optimize chemosensing to signaling cues that directly affect current metabolic
  activities and thus revealing a mechanism by which chemotaxis is coordinated
  with dynamic changes in cell physiology.
