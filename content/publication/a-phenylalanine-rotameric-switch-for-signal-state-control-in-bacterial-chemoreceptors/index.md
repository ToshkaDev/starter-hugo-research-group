abstract: Bacterial chemoreceptors are widely used as a model system for
  elucidating the molecular mechanisms of transmembrane signalling and have
  provided a detailed understanding of how ligand binding by the receptor
  modulates the activity of its associated kinase CheA. However, the mechanisms
  by which conformational signals move between signalling elements within a
  receptor dimer and how they control kinase activity remain unknown. Here,
  using long molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the kinase-activating
  cytoplasmic tip of the chemoreceptor fluctuates between two stable
  conformations in a signal-dependent manner. A highly conserved residue,
  Phe396, appears to serve as the conformational switch, because flipping of the
  stacked aromatic rings of an interacting F396-F396â€² pair in the receptor
  homodimer takes place concomitantly with the signal-related conformational
  changes. We suggest that interacting aromatic residues, which are common
  stabilizers of protein tertiary structure, might serve as rotameric molecular
  switches in other biological processes as well.
