abstract: A rapid method for bacterial chemotaxis in a spatial gradient of
  chemoeffectors has been developed. The method is based on turbidimetric
  measurement of bacteria movement in a chemoeffector gradient created in a
  spectrophotometer cuvette. The method was verified on Escherichia coli mutants
  with known chemotactic properties.
