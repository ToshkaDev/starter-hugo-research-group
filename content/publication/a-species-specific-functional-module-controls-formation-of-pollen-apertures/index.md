abstract: Pollen apertures are an interesting model for the formation of
  specialized plasma-membrane domains. The plant-specific protein INP1 serves as
  a key aperture factor in such distantly related species as Arabidopsis, rice
  and maize. Although INP1 orthologues probably play similar roles throughout
  flowering plants, they show substantial sequence divergence and often cannot
  substitute for each other, suggesting that INP1 might require species-specific
  partners. Here, we present a new aperture factor, INP2, which satisfies the
  criteria for being a species-specific partner for INP1. Both INP proteins
  display similar structural features, including the plant-specific DOG1 domain,
  similar patterns of expression and mutant phenotypes, as well as signs of
  co-evolution. These proteins interact with each other in a species-specific
  manner and can restore apertures in a heterologous system when both are
  expressed but not when expressed individually. Our findings suggest that the
  INP proteins form a species-specific functional module that underlies
  formation of pollen apertures.
