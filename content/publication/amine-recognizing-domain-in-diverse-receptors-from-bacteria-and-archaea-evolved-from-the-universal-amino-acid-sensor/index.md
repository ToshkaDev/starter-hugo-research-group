abstract: Cells possess numerous receptors that modulate signaling pathways.
  While hundreds of thousands of receptor sequences are available in databases,
  the signals that receptors recognize remain largely unknown. Here, we used a
  structure/sequence approach to identify thousands of microbial proteins with
  the predicted capability to detect biogenic amines. We selected several
  targets for experimental validation and demonstrated that all of them bind
  various amines. Amines are key nutrients and major neurotransmitters.
  Identification of amine sensors in bacteria inhabiting the human gut as well
  as in plant- and human pathogens opens research directions for those studying
  these important microbes. By revealing that amine-sensing receptors originated
  from amino acidâ€“sensing receptors, we show how receptors can change their
  specificity during evolution.
