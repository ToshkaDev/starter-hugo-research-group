abstract: Amino acids are the building blocks of life, and they are also
  recognized as signals by various receptors in bacteria, archaea, and
  eukaryotes. Despite their common basic structure, no universal mechanism for
  amino acid recognition is currently known. Here, we show that a subclass of
  dCache_1 (double domain found in calcium channels and chemotaxis receptors,
  family 1), a ubiquitous extracellular sensory domain, contains a simple motif,
  which recognizes the amino and carboxyl groups of amino acid ligands. We found
  this motif throughout the Tree of Life. In bacteria and archaea, this motif
  exclusively binds amino acids, including γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and it is
  present in all major receptor types. In humans, this motif is found in
  α2δ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels that are implicated in
  neuropathic pain and neurodevelopmental disorders and in a recently
  characterized CACHD1 protein. Our findings suggest that GABA-derived drugs
  bind to the same motif in human α2δ-subunits that binds natural GABA ligands
  in bacterial chemoreceptors. The exact location on the target protein and the
  mechanism of binding may enable future improvements of drugs targeting pain
  and neurobiological disorders.
