abstract: LuxR-type transcription factors are the master regulators of quorum
  sensing in vibrios. LuxR proteins are unique members of the TetR superfamily
  of transcription factors because they activate and repress large regulons of
  genes. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation and nucleotide sequencing
  (ChIP-seq) to identify LuxR binding sites in the Vibrio harveyi genome.
  Bioinformatics analyses showed that the LuxR consensus binding site at
  repressed promoters is a symmetric palindrome, whereas at activated promoters
  it is asymmetric and contains only half of the palindrome. Using a genetic
  screen, we isolated LuxR mutants that separated activation and repression
  functions at representative promoters. These LuxR mutants exhibit
  sequence-specific DNA binding defects that restrict activation or repression
  activity to subsets of target promoters. Altering the LuxR DNA binding site
  sequence to one more closely resembling the ideal LuxR consensus motif can
  restore in vivo function to a LuxR mutant. This study provides a mechanistic
  understanding of how a single protein can recognize a variety of binding sites
  to differentially regulate gene expression.
