abstract: An RNA-binding domain exemplified by the AmiR protein was detected in
  various response regulators of the two-component systems and in one-component
  sensory regulators from different bacterial lineages, including important
  pathogens and symbionts. Transcription antitermination appears to be a common
  mechanism for controlling gene expression by this family of regulators.
