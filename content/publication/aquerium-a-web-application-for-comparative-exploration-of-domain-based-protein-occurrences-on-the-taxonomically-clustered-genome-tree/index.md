abstract: Gene duplication and loss are major driving forces in evolution. While
  many important genomic resources provide information on gene presence, there
  is a lack of tools giving equal importance to presence and absence information
  as well as web platforms enabling easy visual comparison of multiple
  domain-based protein occurrences at once. Here, we present Aquerium, a
  platform for visualizing genomic presence and absence of biomolecules with a
  focus on protein domain architectures. The web server offers advanced domain
  organization querying against the database of pre-computed domains for ∼26,000
  organisms and it can be utilized for identification of evolutionary events,
  such as fusion, disassociation, duplication, and shuffling of protein domains.
  The tool also allows alternative inputs of custom entries or BLASTP results
  for visualization. Aquerium will be a useful tool for biologists who perform
  comparative genomic and evolutionary analyses. The web server is freely
  accessible at http://aquerium.utk.edu. Proteins 2016; 85:72–77. © 2016 Wiley
