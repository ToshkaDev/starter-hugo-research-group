abstract: In contrast to Escherichia coli, a model organism for chemotaxis that
  has 5 chemoreceptors and a single chemosensory pathway, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  PAO1 has a much more complex chemosensory network, which consists of 26
  chemoreceptors feeding into four chemosensory pathways. While several
  chemoreceptors were rigorously linked to specific pathways in a series of
  experimental studies, for most of them this information is not available.
  Thus, we addressed the problem computationally. Protein–protein interaction
  network prediction, coexpression data mining, and phylogenetic profiling all
  produced incomplete and uncertain assignments of chemoreceptors to pathways.
  However, comparative sequence analysis specifically targeting chemoreceptor
  regions involved in pathway interactions revealed conserved sequence patterns
  that enabled us to unambiguously link all 26 chemoreceptors to four pathways.
  Placing computational evidence in the context of experimental data allowed us
  to conclude that three chemosensory pathways in P. aeruginosa utilize one
  chemoreceptor per pathway, whereas the fourth pathway, which is the main
  system controlling chemotaxis, utilizes the other 23 chemoreceptors. Our
  results show that while only a very few amino acid positions in receptors,
  kinases, and adaptors determine their pathway specificity, assigning receptors
  to pathways computationally is possible. This requires substantial knowledge
  about interacting partners on a molecular level and focusing comparative
  sequence analysis on the pathway-specific regions. This general principle
  should be applicable to resolving many other receptor–pathway interactions.
