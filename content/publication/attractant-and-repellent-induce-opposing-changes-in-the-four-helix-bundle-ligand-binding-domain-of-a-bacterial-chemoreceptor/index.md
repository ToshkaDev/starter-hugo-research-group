abstract: Motile bacteria navigate toward favorable conditions and away from
  unfavorable environments using chemotaxis. Mechanisms of sensing attractants
  are well understood; however, molecular aspects of how bacteria sense
  repellents have not been established. Here, we identified malate as a
  repellent recognized by the MCP2201 chemoreceptor in a bacterium Comamonas
  testosteroni and showed that it binds to the same site as an attractant
  citrate. Binding determinants for a repellent and an attractant had only minor
  differences, and a single amino acid substitution in the binding site inverted
  the response to malate from a repellent to an attractant. We found that malate
  and citrate affect the oligomerization state of the ligand-binding domain in
  opposing way. We also observed opposing effects of repellent and attractant
  binding on the orientation of an alpha helix connecting the sensory domain to
  the transmembrane helix. We propose a model to illustrate how positive and
  negative signals might be generated.
