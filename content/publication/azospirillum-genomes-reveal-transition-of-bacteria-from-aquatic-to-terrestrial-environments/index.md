abstract: Fossil records indicate that life appeared in marine environments ∼3.5
  billion years ago (Gyr) and transitioned to terrestrial ecosystems nearly 2.5
  Gyr. Sequence analysis suggests that “hydrobacteria” and “terrabacteria” might
  have diverged as early as 3 Gyr. Bacteria of the genus Azospirillum are
  associated with roots of terrestrial plants; however, virtually all their
  close relatives are aquatic. We obtained genome sequences of two Azospirillum
  species and analyzed their gene origins. While most Azospirillum house-keeping
  genes have orthologs in its close aquatic relatives, this lineage has obtained
  nearly half of its genome from terrestrial organisms. The majority of genes
  encoding functions critical for association with plants are among horizontally
  transferred genes. Our results show that transition of some aquatic bacteria
  to terrestrial habitats occurred much later than the suggested initial
  divergence of hydro- and terrabacterial clades. The birth of the genus
  Azospirillum approximately coincided with the emergence of vascular plants on
  land.

summary: Genome sequencing and analysis of plant-associated beneficial soil
  bacteria Azospirillum spp. reveals that these organisms transitioned from
  aquatic to terrestrial environments significantly later than the suggested
  major Precambrian divergence of aquatic and terrestrial bacteria. Separation
  of Azospirillum from their close aquatic relatives coincided with the
  emergence of vascular plants on land. Nearly half of the Azospirillum genome
  has been acquired horizontally, from distantly related terrestrial bacteria.
  The majority of horizontally acquired genes encode functions that are critical
  for adaptation to the rhizosphere and interaction with host plants.
