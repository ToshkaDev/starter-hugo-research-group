abstract: Many bacterial receptors contain multimodular sensing domains
  indicative of complex sensory processes. The presence of more than one sensing
  module likely permits the integration of multiple signals, although the
  molecular detail and functional relevance for these complex sensors remain
  poorly understood. Bimodular sensory domains are often considered to have
  arisen from the fusion or duplication of monomodular domains. Evolution by
  increasing complexity is generally believed to be a dominant force. Here, we
  suggest the opposite—how a monomodular sensing domain may have evolved from a
  bimodular one. Our findings will thus motivate research to establish whether
  evolution by decreasing complexity is typical of other sensory domains.
