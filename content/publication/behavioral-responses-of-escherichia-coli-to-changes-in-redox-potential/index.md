abstract: Escherichia coli bacteria sensed the redox state in their surroundings
  and they swam to a niche that had a preferred reduction potential. In a
  spatial redox gradient of benzoquinone/benzoquinol, E. coli cells migrated to
  form a sharply defined band. Bacteria swimming out of either face of the band
  tumbled and returned to the preferred conditions at the site of the band. This
  behavioral response was named redox taxis. Redox molecules, such as
  substituted quinones, that elicited redox taxis, interact with the bacterial
  electron transport system, thereby altering electron transport and the proton
  motive force. The magnitude of the behavioral response was dependent on the
  reduction potential of the chemoeffector. The Tsr, Tar, Trg, Tap, and CheR
  proteins, which have a role in chemotaxis, were not essential for redox taxis.
  A cheB mutant had inverted responses in redox taxis, as previously
  demonstrated in aerotaxis. A model is proposed in which a redox effector
  molecule perturbs the electron transport system, and an unknown sensor in the
  membrane detects changes in the proton motive force or the redox status of the
  electron transport system, and transduces this information into a signal that
  regulates phosphorylation of the CheA protein. A similar mechanism has been
  proposed for aerotaxis. Redox taxis may play an important role in the
  distribution of bacterial species in natural environments.
