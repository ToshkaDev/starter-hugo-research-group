abstract: Azospirillum brasilense responds to a spatial gradient of oxygen by
  formation of a band in the zone of optimal oxygen concentration. The same
  behaviour was observed in a ‘redox’ gradient of tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine
  (TMPD) oxidized by ferricyanide, under conditions where oxygen uptake was
  inhibited by cyanide. Inhibitors of the bc1-complex of the redox chain did not
  inhibit aerotaxis. Cells inhibited by a high cyanide concentration still
  showed slow motility and weak attraction to oxygen, possibly as a result of
  cyanide-resistant respiration (3–5% of the initial level). It is suggested
  that electron flow through the redox chain (and/or consequent changes in
  protonmotive force), rather than binding of oxygen to terminal oxidases, may
  be a signal in the aerotactic response of A. brasilense.
