abstract: Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels form three sub-families (CaV1-3).
  The CaV1 and CaV2 channels are heteromeric, consisting of an α1 pore-forming
  subunit, associated with auxiliary CaVβ and α2δ subunits. The α2δ subunits are
  encoded in mammals by four genes, CACNA2D1-4. They play important roles in
  trafficking and function of the CaV channel complexes. Here we report
  biallelic variants in CACNA2D1, encoding the α2δ-1 protein, in two unrelated
  individuals showing a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE).
  Patient 1 has a homozygous frameshift variant c.818_821dup/p.(Ser275Asnfs*13)
  resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of the CACNA2D1 transcripts, and
  absence of α2δ-1 protein detected in patient-derived fibroblasts. Patient 2 is
  compound heterozygous for an early frameshift variant
  c.13_23dup/p.(Leu9Alafs*5), highly likely representing a null allele, and a
  missense variant c.626G>A/p.(Gly209Asp). Our functional studies show that this
  amino-acid change severely impairs the function of α2δ-1 as a calcium channel
  subunit, with strongly reduced trafficking of α2δ-1G209D to the cell surface,
  and a complete inability of α2δ-1G209D to increase the trafficking and
  function of CaV2 channels. Thus biallelic loss-of-function variants in
  CACNA2D1 underlie the severe neurodevelopmental disorder in these two
  patients. Our results demonstrate the critical importance and
  non-interchangeability of α2δ-1 and other α2δ proteins for normal human
  neuronal development.
