abstract: Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 (LB400), a well studied, effective
  polychlorinated biphenyl-degrader, has one of the two largest known bacterial
  genomes and is the first nonpathogenic Burkholderia isolate sequenced. From an
  evolutionary perspective, we find significant differences in functional
  specialization between the three replicons of LB400, as well as a more relaxed
  selective pressure for genes located on the two smaller vs. the largest
  replicon. High genomic plasticity, diversity, and specialization within the
  Burkholderia genus are exemplified by the conservation of only 44% of the
  genes between LB400 and Burkholderia cepacia complex strain 383. Even among
  four B. xenovorans strains, genome size varies from 7.4 to 9.73 Mbp. The
  latter is largely explained by our findings that >20% of the LB400 sequence
  was recently acquired by means of lateral gene transfer. Although a range of
  genetic factors associated with in vivo survival and intercellular
  interactions are present, these genetic factors are likely related to niche
  breadth rather than determinants of pathogenicity. The presence of at least
  eleven “central aromatic” and twenty “peripheral aromatic” pathways in LB400,
  among the highest in any sequenced bacterial genome, supports this hypothesis.
  Finally, in addition to the experimentally observed redundancy in benzoate
  degradation and formaldehyde oxidation pathways, the fact that 17.6% of
  proteins have a better LB400 paralog than an ortholog in a different genome
  highlights the importance of gene duplication and repeated acquirement, which,
  coupled with their divergence, raises questions regarding the role of paralogs
  and potential functional redundancies in large-genome microbes.
