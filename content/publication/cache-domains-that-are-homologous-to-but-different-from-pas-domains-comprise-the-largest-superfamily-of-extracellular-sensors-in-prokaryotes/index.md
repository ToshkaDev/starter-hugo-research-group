abstract: Cellular receptors usually contain a designated sensory domain that
  recognizes the signal. Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) domains are ubiquitous sensors in
  thousands of species ranging from bacteria to humans. Although PAS domains
  were described as intracellular sensors, recent structural studies revealed
  PAS-like domains in extracytoplasmic regions in several transmembrane
  receptors. However, these structurally defined extracellular PAS-like domains
  do not match sequence-derived PAS domain models, and thus their distribution
  across the genomic landscape remains largely unknown. Here we show that
  structurally defined extracellular PAS-like domains belong to the Cache
  superfamily, which is homologous to, but distinct from the PAS superfamily.
  Our newly built computational models enabled identification of Cache domains
  in tens of thousands of signal transduction proteins including those from
  important pathogens and model organisms. Furthermore, we show that Cache
  domains comprise the dominant mode of extracellular sensing in prokaryotes.
