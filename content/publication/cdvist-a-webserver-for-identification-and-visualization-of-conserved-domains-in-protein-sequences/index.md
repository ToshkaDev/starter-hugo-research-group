  Summary: Identification of domains in protein sequences allows their assigning
  to biological functions. Several webservers exist for identification of
  protein domains using similarity searches against various databases of protein
  domain models. However, none of them provides comprehensive domain coverage
  while allowing bulk querying and their visualization schemes can be improved.
  To address these issues, we developed CDvist (a comprehensive domain
  visualization tool), which combines the best available search algorithms and
  databases into a user-friendly framework. First, a given protein sequence is
  matched to domain models using high-specificity tools and only then unmatched
  segments are subjected to more sensitive algorithms resulting in a best
  possible comprehensive coverage. Bulk querying and rich visualization and
  download options provide improved functionality to domain architecture
  analysis.
