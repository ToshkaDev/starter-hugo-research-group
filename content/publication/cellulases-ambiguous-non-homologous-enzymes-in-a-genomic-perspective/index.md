abstract: The key material for bioethanol production is cellulose, which is one
  of the main components of the plant cell wall. Enzymatic depolymerization of
  cellulose is an essential step in bioethanol production, and can be
  accomplished by fungal and bacterial cellulases. Most of the biochemically
  characterized bacterial cellulases come from only a few cellulose-degrading
  bacteria, thus limiting our knowledge of a range of cellulolytic activities
  that exist in nature. The recent explosion of genomic data offers a unique
  opportunity to search for novel cellulolytic activities; however, the absence
  of clear understanding of structural and functional features that are
  important for reliable computational identification of cellulases precludes
  their exploration in the genomic datasets. Here, we explore the diversity of
  cellulases and propose a genomic approach to overcome this bottleneck.
