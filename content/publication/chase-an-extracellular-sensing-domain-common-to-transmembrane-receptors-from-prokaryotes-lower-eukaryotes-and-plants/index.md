abstract: A novel extracellular ligand-binding domain, termed CHASE, is
  described in sensory adenylyl and diguanylate cyclases, and histidine kinases,
  in several bacterial species, Dictyostelium and plants. The CHASE domain is
  predicted to sense stimuli that are specific for the developmental program of
  an organism.
