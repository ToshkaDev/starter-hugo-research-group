abstract: Chemotaxis by Bacillus subtilis requires the inter-acting chemotaxis
  proteins CheC and CheD. In this study, we show that CheD is absolutely
  required for a behavioural response to proline mediated by McpC but is not
  required for the response to asparagine mediated by McpB. We also show that
  CheC is not required for the excitation response to asparagine stimulation but
  is required for adaptation while asparagine remains complexed with the McpB
  chemoreceptor. CheC displayed an interaction with the histidine kinase CheA as
  well as with McpB in the yeast two-hybrid assay, suggesting that the mechanism
  by which CheC affects adaptation may result from an interaction with the
  receptorâ€“CheA complex. Furthermore, CheC was found to be related to the family
  of flagellar switch proteins comprising FliM and FliY but is not present in
  many proteobacterial genomes in which CheD homologues exist. The distinct
  physiological roles for CheC and CheD during B. subtilis chemotaxis and the
  observation that CheD is present in bacterial genomes that lack CheC indicate
  that these proteins can function independently and may define unique pathways
  during chemotactic signal transduction. We speculate that CheC interacts with
  flagellar switch components and dissociates upon CheY-P binding and
  subsequently interacts with the receptor complex to facilitate adaptation.
