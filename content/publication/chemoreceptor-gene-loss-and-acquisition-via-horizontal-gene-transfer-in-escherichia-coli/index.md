abstract: Chemotaxis allows bacteria to more efficiently colonize optimal
  microhabitats within their larger environment. Chemotaxis in Escherichia coli
  is the best-studied model system, and a large number of E. coli strains have
  been sequenced. The Escherichia/Shigella genus encompasses a great variety of
  commensal and pathogenic strains, but the role of chemotaxis in their
  association with the host remains poorly understood. Here we show that the
  core chemotaxis genes are lost in many, but not all, nonmotile strains but are
  well preserved in all motile strains. The genes encoding the Tar, Tsr, and Aer
  chemoreceptors, which mediate chemotaxis to a broad spectrum of chemical and
  physical cues, are also nearly uniformly conserved in motile strains. In
  contrast, the clade of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli strains apparently
  underwent an ancestral loss of Trg and Tap chemoreceptors, which sense sugars,
  dipeptides, and pyrimidines. The broad range of time estimated for the loss of
  these genes (1 to 3 million years ago) corresponds to the appearance of the
  genus Homo.
