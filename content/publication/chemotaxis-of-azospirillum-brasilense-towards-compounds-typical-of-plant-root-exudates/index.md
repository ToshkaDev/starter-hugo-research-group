abstract: Nitrogen-fixing Azospirillum brasilense exhibits positive chemotaxis
  towards a large number of organic compounds (amino acids, saccharides, organic
  acids) typical for plant root exudates. The most effective attractants were
  malate, succinate, fructose and other compounds, which serve as substrates for
  A. brasilense. Chemotactic response towards the majority of compounds was
  inducible, but in case of malate and succinate it was constitutive. Tactic
  response during the nitrogen-fixing process was essentially the same as in the
  presence of fixed nitrogen in the medium. Among organic compounds tested no
  repellents were found.
