abstract: "Histidine kinases are key components of regulatory systems that
  enable bacteria to respond to environmental changes. Two major classes of
  histidine kinases are recognized on the basis of their modular design:
  classical (HKI) and chemotaxis specific (HKII). Recently, a new type of
  histidine kinase that appeared to have features of both HKIs and HKIIs was
  identified and termed HKIII; however, the details of HKIII's relationship to
  other two classes of histidine kinases, their function, and evolutionary
  history remain unknown. Here, we carried out genomic, phylogenetic, and
  protein sequence analyses that allowed us to reveal the unusual evolutionary
  history of this protein family, formalize its distinctive features, and
  propose its putative function. HKIIIs are characterized by the presence of
  sensory domains and the lack of a dimerization domain, which is typically
  present in all histidine kinases. In addition to a single-domain response
  regulator, HKIII signal transduction systems utilize CheX phosphatase and, in
  many instances, an unorthodox soluble chemoreceptor that are usual components
  of chemotaxis signal transduction systems. However, many HKIII genes are found
  in genomes completely lacking chemotaxis genes, thus decoupling their function
  from chemotaxis. By contrast, all HKIII-containing genomes also contain pilT,
  a marker gene for bacterial type IV pilus-based motility, whose regulation is
  proposed as a putative function for HKIII. These signal transduction systems
  have a narrow phyletic distribution but are present in many emerging and
  opportunistic pathogens, thus offering an attractive potential target for
  future antimicrobial drug design."
