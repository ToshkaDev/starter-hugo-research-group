abstract: Molecular machinery governing bacterial chemotaxis consists of the
  CheA–CheY two‐component system, an array of specialized chemoreceptors, and
  several auxiliary proteins. It has been studied extensively in Escherichia
  coli and, to a significantly lesser extent, in several other microbial
  species. Emerging evidence suggests that homologous signal transduction
  pathways regulate not only chemotaxis, but several other cellular functions in
  various bacterial species. The availability of genome sequence data for
  hundreds of organisms enables productive study of this system using
  comparative genomics and protein sequence analysis. This chapter describes
  advances in genomics of the chemotaxis signal transduction system, provides
  information on relevant bioinformatics tools and resources, and outlines
  approaches toward developing a computational framework for predicting
  important biological functions from raw genomic data based on available
  experimental evidence.
