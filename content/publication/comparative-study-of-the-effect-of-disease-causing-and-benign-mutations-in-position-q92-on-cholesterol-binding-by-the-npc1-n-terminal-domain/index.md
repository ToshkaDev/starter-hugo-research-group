abstract: The Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein is a large transmembrane
  protein located in lysosomes/endosomes. NPC1 binds cholesterol (CLR) and
  transports it to cellular membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in
  NPC1 cause Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, a rare autosomal disorder
  characterized by intracellular accumulations of CLR and subsequent
  neurodegeneration leading to premature death. Among known disease-causing
  mutations in NPC1, Q92R is the one that is located in the N-terminal
  cholesterol-binding domain [NTD]. Here we study the effect of the mutation on
  the ability of NPC1 (NTD) to bind and retain CLR in the binding pocket using
  structural analysis. We compare characteristics of the Q92R and Q92S mutant
  type (MT) protein, which is predicted to be benign. We provide detailed
  investigation of the CLR-NPC1 (NTD) binding process; and propose the
  mechanism, by which Q92R mutation causes NPC disease. We show that although
  Q92 residue neither directly participates in catalytic activity of the NPC1
  (NTD), nor defines its CLR-binding specificity - it is important for the
  overall protein structure as well as for providing favorable electrostatic
  environment for CLR transfer. Our results suggest that a negative
  electrostatic potential of the CLR binding site (the S-opening) might promote
  NPC2 interaction with NPC1 (NTD) and/or proper CLR orientation and its
  enforced transfer. We show that in contrast to the benign Q92S mutation, Q92R
  significantly reduces electrostatic potential around S-opening, and thus
  likely affects NPC1 (NTD)-NPC2 interaction and/or CLR transfer from NPC2 to
  NPC1.
