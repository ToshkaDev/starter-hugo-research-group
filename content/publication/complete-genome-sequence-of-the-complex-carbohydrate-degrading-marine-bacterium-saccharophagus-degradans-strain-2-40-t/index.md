abstract: The marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 (Sde 2-40)
  is emerging as a vanguard of a recently discovered group of marine and
  estuarine bacteria that recycles complex polysaccharides. We report its
  complete genome sequence, analysis of which identifies an unusually large
  number of enzymes that degrade >10 complex polysaccharides. Not only is this
  an extraordinary range of catabolic capability, many of the enzymes exhibit
  unusual architecture including novel combinations of catalytic and
  substrate-binding modules. We hypothesize that many of these features are
  adaptations that facilitate depolymerization of complex polysaccharides in the
  marine environment. This is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium
  that can degrade plant cell walls, an important component of the carbon cycle
  that is not well-characterized in the marine environment.
