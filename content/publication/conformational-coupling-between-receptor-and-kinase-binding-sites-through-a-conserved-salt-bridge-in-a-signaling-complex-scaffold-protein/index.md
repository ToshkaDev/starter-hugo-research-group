abstract: Bacterial chemotaxis is one of the best studied signal transduction
  pathways. CheW is a scaffold protein that mediates the association of the
  chemoreceptors and the CheA kinase in a ternary signaling complex. The effects
  of replacing conserved Arg62 of CheW with other residues suggested that the
  scaffold protein plays a more complex role than simply binding its partner
  proteins. Although R62A CheW had essentially the same affinity for
  chemoreceptors and CheA, cells expressing the mutant protein are impaired in
  chemotaxis. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations (MD), NMR
  spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD), we addressed the role of Arg62.
  Here we show that Arg62 forms a salt bridge with another highly conserved
  residue, Glu38. Although this interaction is unimportant for overall protein
  stability, it is essential to maintain the correct alignment of the
  chemoreceptor and kinase binding sites of CheW. Computational and experimental
  data suggest that the role of the salt bridge in maintaining the alignment of
  the two partner binding sites is fundamental to the function of the signaling
  complex but not to its assembly. We conclude that a key feature of CheW is to
  maintain the specific geometry between the two interaction sites required for
  its function as a scaffold.
