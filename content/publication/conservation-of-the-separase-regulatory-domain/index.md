abstract: We report a protein sequence analysis of the cell cycle regulatory
  protease, separase. The sequence and structural conservation of the C-terminal
  protease domain has long been recognized, whereas the N-terminal regulatory
  domain of separase was reported to lack detectable sequence similarity. Here
  we reveal significant sequence conservation of the separase regulatory domain
  and report a discovery of a cysteine motif (CxCxxC) conserved in major
  lineages of Metazoa including nematodes and vertebrates. This motif is found
  in a solvent exposed linker region connecting two TPR-like helical motifs.
  Mutation of this motif in Caenorhabditis elegans separase leads to a
  temperature sensitive hypomorphic protein. Conservation of this motif in
  organisms ranging from C. elegans to humans suggests its functional
  importance.
