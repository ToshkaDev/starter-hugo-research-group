abstract: Complex chemosensory systems control multiple biological functions in
  bacteria, such as chemotaxis, gene regulation, and cell cycle progression.
  Many species contain more than one chemosensory system per genome, but little
  is known about their potential interplay. In this study, we reveal cross talk
  between two chemosensory pathways that modulate chemotaxis and biofilm
  formation in Comamonas testosteroni. We demonstrate that some chemoreceptors
  that govern chemotaxis also contribute to biofilm formation and these
  chemoreceptors can physically interact with components of both pathways.
  Finally, we show that the chemotaxis histidine kinase CheA can phosphorylate
  not only its cognate response regulator CheY2 but also one of the response
  regulators from the pathway mediating biofilm formation, FlmD. The phosphoryl
  group transfer from CheA to CheY2 is much faster than that from CheA to FlmD,
  which is consistent with chemotaxis being a fast response and biofilm
  formation being a much slower developmental process. We propose that cross
  talk between chemosensory pathways may play a role in coordination of complex
  behaviors in bacteria.

**IMPORTANCE** In many bacteria, two or more homologous chemosensory pathways control several cellular functions, such as motility and gene regulation, in response to changes in the cell’s microenvironment. Cross talk between signal transduction systems is poorly understood; while generally it is considered to be undesired, in some instances it might be beneficial for coregulation of complex behaviors. We demonstrate that several receptors from the pathway controlling motility can physically interact with downstream components of the pathway controlling biofilm formation. We further show that a kinase from the pathway controlling motility can also phosphorylate a response regulator from the pathway controlling biofilm formation. We propose that cross talk between two chemosensory pathways might be involved in coordination of two types of cell behavior—chemotaxis and biofilm formation.
