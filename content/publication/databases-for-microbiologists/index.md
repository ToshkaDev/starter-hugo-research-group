abstract: Databases play an increasingly important role in biology. They
  archive, store, maintain, and share information on genes, genomes, expression
  data, protein sequences and structures, metabolites and reactions,
  interactions, and pathways. All these data are critically important to
  microbiologists. Furthermore, microbiology has its own databases that deal
  with model microorganisms, microbial diversity, physiology, and pathogenesis.
  Thousands of biological databases are currently available, and it becomes
  increasingly difficult to keep up with their development. The purpose of this
  minireview is to provide a brief survey of current databases that are of
  interest to microbiologists.
