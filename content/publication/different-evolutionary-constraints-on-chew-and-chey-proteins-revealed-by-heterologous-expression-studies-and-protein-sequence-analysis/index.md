abstract: CheW and CheY are single-domain proteins from a signal transduction
  pathway that transmits information from transmembrane receptors to flagellar
  motors in bacterial chemotaxis. In various bacterial and archaeal species, the
  cheW and cheY genes are usually encoded within homologous chemotaxis operons.
  We examined evolutionary changes in these two proteins from distantly related
  proteobacterial species, Escherichia coli and Azospirillum brasilense. We
  analyzed the functions of divergent CheW and CheY proteins from A. brasilense
  by heterologous expression in E. coli wild-type and mutant strains. Both
  proteins were able to specifically inhibit chemotaxis of a wild-type E. coli
  strain; however, only CheW from A. brasilense was able to restore signal
  transduction in a corresponding mutant of E. coli. Detailed protein sequence
  analysis of CheW and CheY homologs from the two species revealed substantial
  differences in the types of amino acid substitutions in the two proteins.
  Multiple, but conservative, substitutions were found in CheW homologs. No
  severe mismatches were found between the CheW homologs in positions that are
  known to be structurally or functionally important. Substitutions in CheY
  homologs were found to be less conservative and occurred in positions that are
  critical for interactions with other components of the signal transduction
  pathway. Our findings suggest that proteins from the same cellular pathway
  encoded by genes from the same operon have different evolutionary constraints
  on their structures that reflect differences in their functions.
