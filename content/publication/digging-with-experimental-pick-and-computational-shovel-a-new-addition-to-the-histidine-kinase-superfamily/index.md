abstract: "Experimental microbiology in the postgenomic era has survived the
  first wave of uncertainty: a perspective of being replaced by in silico
  microbiology. Although it is clear now that experimental science is
  irreplaceable, we are facing yet another wave: the frustration of having a
  half million microbial genes in databases but lacking simple ways of getting
  biologically relevant information. Therefore, it is reassuring to see some
  clear water between the waves: examples of experimental research that takes
  advantage of a comparative genomic approach one step at a time. The paper by
  Karniol and Vierstra in this issue (10) describing a new family of histidine
  kinases shows how the use of simple bioinformatics tools by microbiologists
  can (i) identify new targets for experimental work and (ii) provide important
  feedback for improving these tools."
