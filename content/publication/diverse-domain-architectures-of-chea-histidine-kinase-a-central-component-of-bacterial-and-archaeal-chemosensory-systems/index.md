abstract: Chemosensory systems in bacteria and archaea are complex,
  multi-protein pathways that enable rapid cellular responses to environmental
  changes. The CheA histidine kinase is a central component of chemosensory
  systems. In contrast to other histidine kinases, it lacks a sensor (input)
  domain and utilizes dedicated chemoreceptors for sensing. CheA is a
  multi-domain protein; in model organisms as diverse as Escherichia coli and
  Bacillus subtilis, it contains five single-copy domains. Deviations from this
  canonical domain architecture have been reported, however, a broad genome-wide
  analysis of CheA diversity is lacking. Here, we present the results of a
  genomic survey of CheA domain composition carried out using an unbiased set of
  thousands of CheA sequences from bacteria and archaea. We found that four out
  of five canonical CheA domains comprise a minimal functional unit (core
  domains), as they are present in all surveyed CheA homologs. The most common
  deviations from a classical five-domain CheA architecture are the lack of a
  P2/CheY-binding domain, which is missing from more than half of CheA homologs,
  and the acquisition of a response regulator receiver (CheY-like) domain, which
  is present in ~35% of CheA homologs. We also document other deviations from
  classical CheA architecture, including bipartite CheA proteins, domain
  duplications, and fusions, and reveal that phylogenetically defined CheA
  classes have pre-dominant domain architectures. This study lays a foundation
  for a better classification of CheA homologs and identifies targets for
  experimental investigations.
