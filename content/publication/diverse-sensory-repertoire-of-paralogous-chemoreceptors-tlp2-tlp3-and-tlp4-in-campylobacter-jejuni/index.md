abstract: "Campylobacter jejuni responds to extracellular stimuli via
  transducer-like chemoreceptors (Tlps). Here, we describe receptor-ligand
  interactions of a unique paralogue family of dCache_1 (double Calcium channels
  and chemotaxis) chemoreceptors: Tlp2, Tlp3, and Tlp4. Phylogenetic analysis
  revealed that Tlp2, Tlp3, and Tlp4 receptors may have arisen through domain
  duplications, followed by a divergent evolutionary drift, with Tlp3 emerging
  more recently, and unexpectedly, responded to glycans, as well as multiple
  organic and amino acids with overlapping specificities. All three Tlps
  interacted with five monosaccharides and complex glycans, including Lewisâ€™s
  antigens, P antigens, and fucosyl GM1 ganglioside, indicating a potential role
  in host-pathogen interactions. Analysis of chemotactic motility of single,
  double, and triple mutants indicated that these chemoreceptors are likely to
  work together to balance responses to attractants and repellents to modulate
  chemotaxis in C. jejuni. Molecular docking experiments, in combination with
  saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
  competition surface plasmon resonance analysis, illustrated that the
  ligand-binding domain of Tlp3 possess one major binding pocket with two
  overlapping, but distinct binding sites able to interact with multiple
  ligands. A diverse sensory repertoire could provide C. jejuni with the ability
  to modulate responses to attractant and repellent signals and allow for
  adaptation in host-pathogen interactions."
