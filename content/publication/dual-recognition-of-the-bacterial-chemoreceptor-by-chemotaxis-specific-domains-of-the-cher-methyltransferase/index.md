abstract: "Adaptation to persisting stimulation is required for highly sensitive
  detection of temporal changes of stimuli, and often involves covalent
  modification of receptors. Therefore, it is of vital importance to understand
  how a receptor and its cognate modifying enzyme(s) modulate each other through
  specific protein-protein interactions. In the chemotaxis of Escherichia coli,
  adaptation requires methylation of chemoreceptors (e.g.Tar) catalyzed by the
  CheR methyltransferase. CheR binds to the C-terminal NWETF sequence of a
  chemoreceptor that is distinct from the methylation sites. However, little is
  known about how CheR recognizes its methylation sites or how it is distributed
  in a cell. In this study, we used comparative genomics to demonstrate that the
  CheR chemotaxis methyltransferase contains three structurally and functionally
  distinct modules: (i) the catalytic domain common to a methyltransferase
  superfamily; (ii) the N-terminal domain; and (iii) the β-subdomain of the
  catalytic domain, both of which are found exclusively in chemotaxis
  methyltransferases. The only evolutionary conserved motif specific to CheR is
  the positively charged face of helix α2 in the N-terminal domain. The
  disulfide cross-linking analysis suggested that this face interacts with the
  methylation helix of Tar. We also demonstrated that CheR localizes to receptor
  clusters at cell poles via interaction of the β-subdomain with the NWETF
  sequence. Thus, the two chemotaxis-specific modules of CheR interact with
  distinct regions of the chemoreceptor for targeting to the receptor cluster
  and for recognition of the substrate sites, respectively."
