abstract: Motile microorganisms rapidly respond to changes in various
  physico-chemical gradients by directing their motility to more favorable
  surroundings. Energy generation is one of the most important parameters for
  the survival of microorganisms in their environment. Therefore it is not
  surprising that microorganisms are able to monitor changes in the cellular
  energy generating processes. The signal for this behavioral response, which is
  called energy taxis, originates within the electron transport system. By
  coupling energy metabolism and behavior, energy taxis is fine-tuned to the
  environment a cell finds itself in and allows efficient adaptation to changing
  conditions that affect cellular energy levels. Thus, energy taxis provides
  cells with a versatile sensory system that enables them to navigate to niches
  where energy generation is optimized. This behavior is likely to govern
  vertical species stratification and the active migration of motile cells in
  response to shifting gradients of electron donors and/or acceptors which are
  observed within microbial mats, sediments and soil pores. Energy taxis has
  been characterized in several species and might be widespread in the microbial
  world. Genome sequencing revealed that many microorganisms from aquatic and
  soil environments possess large numbers of chemoreceptors and are likely to be
  capable of energy taxis. In contrast, species that have a fewer number of
  chemoreceptors are often found in specific, confined environments, where
  relatively constant environmental conditions are expected. Future studies
  focusing on characterizing behavioral responses in species that are adapted to
  diverse environmental conditions should unravel the molecular mechanisms
  underlying sensory behavior in general and energy taxis in particular. Such
  knowledge is critical to a better understanding of the ecological role of
  energy taxis.
