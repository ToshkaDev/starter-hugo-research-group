abstract: Bacteria have evolved a sophisticated array of signal transduction
  systems that allow them to adapt their physiology and metabolism to changing
  environmental conditions. Typically, these systems recognize signals through
  dedicated ligand binding domains (LBDs) to ultimately trigger a diversity of
  physiological responses. Nonetheless, an increasing number of reports reveal
  that signal transduction receptors also bind antagonists to inhibit responses
  mediated by agonists. The mechanisms by which antagonists block the downstream
  signaling cascade remain largely unknown. To advance our knowledge in this
  field, we used the LysR-type transcriptional regulator AdmX as a model. AdmX
  activates the expression of an antibiotic biosynthetic cluster in the
  rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica. AdmX specifically recognizes the auxin
  phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and its biosynthetic intermediate
  indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) as signals. However, only IAA, but not IPA, was
  shown to regulate antibiotic production in S. plymuthica. Here, we report the
  high-resolution structures of the LBD of AdmX in complex with IAA and IPA. We
  found that IAA and IPA compete for binding to AdmX. Although IAA and IPA
  binding does not alter the oligomeric state of AdmX, IPA binding causes a
  higher degree of compactness in the protein structure. Molecular dynamics
  simulations revealed significant differences in the binding modes of IAA and
  IPA by AdmX, and the inspection of the three-dimensional structures evidenced
  differential agonist- and antagonist-mediated structural changes. Key residues
  for auxin binding were identified and an auxin recognition motif defined.
  Phylogenetic clustering supports the recent evolutionary emergence of this
  motif specifically in plant-associated enterobacteria.
