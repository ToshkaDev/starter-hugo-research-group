abstract: Energy taxis encompasses aerotaxis, phototaxis, redox taxis, taxis to
  alternative electron acceptors, and chemotaxis to oxidizable substrates. The
  signal for this type of behavior is originated within the electron transport
  system. Energy taxis was demonstrated, as a part of an overall behavior, in
  several microbial species, but it did not appear as the dominant determinant
  in any of them. In this study, we show that most behavioral responses proceed
  through this mechanism in the alpha-proteobacterium Azospirillum brasilense.
  First, chemotaxis to most chemoeffectors typical of the azospirilla habitat
  was found to be metabolism dependent and required a functional electron
  transport system. Second, other energy-related responses, such as aerotaxis,
  redox taxis, and taxis to alternative electron acceptors, were found in A.
  brasilense. Finally, a mutant lacking a cytochromec oxidase of the cbb3 type
  was affected in chemotaxis, redox taxis, and aerotaxis. Altogether, the
  results indicate that behavioral responses to most stimuli inA. brasilense are
  triggered by changes in the electron transport system.
