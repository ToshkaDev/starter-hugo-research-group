abstract: Two-component signal transduction systems are abundant in prokaryotes.
  They enable cells to adjust multiple cellular functions in response to
  changing environmental conditions. These systems are also found, although in
  much smaller numbers, in lower eukaryotes and plants, where they appear to
  control a few very specific functions. Two-component systems have evolved in
  Bacteria from much simpler one-component systems bringing about the benefit of
  extracellular versus intracellular sensing. We review reports establishing the
  origins of two-component systems and documenting their occurrence in major
  lineages of Life.

  caption: Prokaryotic signal transduction paradigms. Extracellular sensing
    emerged with the advent of TCSs given that 73% of HKs are membrane
    associated compared to only 3% of OCSs [10••]. However, both OCSs and TCSs
    are predicted to predominantly regulate transcription [10••]. The chemotaxis
    system (represented by the canonical E. coli system) employs a number of
    additional components not reported in other TCSs that regulate methylation
    (M) (CheB and CheR), dephosphorylation (CheZ), and scaffolding (CheW)
