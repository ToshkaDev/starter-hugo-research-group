abstract: Two-component signal transduction systems are abundant in prokaryotes.
  They enable cells to adjust multiple cellular functions in response to
  changing environmental conditions. These systems are also found, although in
  much smaller numbers, in lower eukaryotes and plants, where they appear to
  control a few very specific functions. Two-component systems have evolved in
  Bacteria from much simpler one-component systems bringing about the benefit of
  extracellular versus intracellular sensing. We review reports establishing the
  origins of two-component systems and documenting their occurrence in major
  lineages of Life.
