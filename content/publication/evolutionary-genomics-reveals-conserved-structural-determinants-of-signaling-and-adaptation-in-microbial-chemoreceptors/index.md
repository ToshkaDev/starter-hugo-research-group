abstract: "As an important model for transmembrane signaling, methyl-accepting
  chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) have been extensively studied by using genetic,
  biochemical, and structural techniques. However, details of the molecular
  mechanism of signaling are still not well understood. The availability of
  genomic information for hundreds of species enables the identification of
  features in protein sequences that are conserved over long evolutionary
  distances and thus are critically important for function. We carried out a
  large-scale comparative genomic analysis of the MCP signaling and adaptation
  domain family and identified features that appear to be critical for receptor
  structure and function. Based on domain length and sequence conservation, we
  identified seven major MCP classes and three distinct structural regions
  within the cytoplasmic domain: signaling, methylation, and flexible bundle
  subdomains. The flexible bundle subdomain, not previously recognized in MCPs,
  is a conserved element that appears to be important for signal transduction.
  Remarkably, the N- and C-terminal helical arms of the cytoplasmic domain
  maintain symmetry in length and register despite dramatic variation, from 24
  to 64 7-aa heptads in overall domain length. Loss of symmetry is observed in
  some MCPs, where it is concomitant with specific changes in the sensory
  module. Each major MCP class has a distinct pattern of predicted methylation
  sites that is well supported by experimental data. Our findings indicate that
  signaling and adaptation functions within the MCP cytoplasmic domain are
  tightly coupled, and that their coevolution has contributed to the significant
  diversity in chemotaxis mechanisms among different organisms."
