abstract: Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica are models for many
  experiments in molecular biology including chemotaxis, and most of the results
  obtained with one organism have been generalized to another. While most
  components of the chemotaxis pathway are strongly conserved between the two
  species, Salmonella genomes contain some chemoreceptors and an additional
  protein, CheV, that are not found in E. coli. The role of CheV was examined in
  distantly related species Bacillus subtilis and Helicobacter pylori, but its
  role in bacterial chemotaxis is still not well understood. We tested a
  hypothesis that in enterobacteria CheV functions as an additional adaptor
  linking the CheA kinase to certain types of chemoreceptors that cannot be
  effectively accommodated by the universal adaptor CheW. Phylogenetic
  profiling, genomic context and comparative protein sequence analyses suggested
  that CheV interacts with specific domains of CheA and chemoreceptors from an
  orthologous group exemplified by the Salmonella McpC protein. Structural
  consideration of the conservation patterns suggests that CheV and CheW share
  the same binding spot on the chemoreceptor structure, but have some affinity
  bias towards chemoreceptors from different orthologous groups. Finally,
  published experimental results and data newly obtained via comparative
  genomics support the idea that CheV functions as a “phosphate sink” possibly
  to off-set the over-stimulation of the kinase by certain types of
  chemoreceptors. Overall, our results strongly suggest that CheV is an
  additional adaptor for accommodating specific chemoreceptors within the
  chemotaxis signaling complex.
