abstract: Genome sequencing has significantly improved diagnosis and treatment
  of genetic diseases and cancers; however, it produces many variants that
  cannot be easily interpreted. Automated bioinformatics tools can help predict
  functional consequences of variants of uncertain significance, but their
  accuracy is low. Here, by tracing precise evolutionary history of each amino
  acid position in MEK1 kinase (mutations in which cause neurodegenerative
  diseases and cancer), we can establish whether variants seen in humans are
  evolutionarily tolerant. Using published data and experiments, we show that
  evolutionarily tolerable variants in MEK1 are benign, whereas intolerable
  substitutions are damaging. Our approach will help in diagnostics of
  MEK1-associated diseases, it is generalizable to many other disease-associated
  genes, and it can help improve automated predictors.
