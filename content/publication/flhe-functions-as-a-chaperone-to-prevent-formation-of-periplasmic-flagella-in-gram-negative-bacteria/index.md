abstract: The bacterial flagellum, which facilitates motility, is composed of
  ~20 structural proteins organized into a long extracellular filament connected
  to a cytoplasmic rotor-stator complex via a periplasmic rod. Flagellum
  assembly is regulated by multiple checkpoints that ensure an ordered gene
  expression pattern coupled to the assembly of the various building blocks.
  Here, we use epifluorescence, super-resolution, and transmission electron
  microscopy to show that the absence of a periplasmic protein (FlhE) prevents
  proper flagellar morphogenesis and results in the formation of periplasmic
  flagella in Salmonella enterica. The periplasmic flagella disrupt cell wall
  synthesis, leading to a loss of normal cell morphology resulting in cell
  lysis. We propose that FlhE functions as a periplasmic chaperone to control
  assembly of the periplasmic rod, thus preventing formation of periplasmic
  flagella.
