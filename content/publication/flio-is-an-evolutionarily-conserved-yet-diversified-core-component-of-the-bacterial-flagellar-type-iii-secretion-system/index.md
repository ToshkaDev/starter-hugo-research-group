abstract: The bacterial flagellum is a complex nanomachine essential for
  motility, environmental sensing, and host colonization. While many of its core
  components have been well characterized, the relevance of proteins such as
  FliO, which are inconsistently annotated and poorly conserved at the sequence
  level, has remained ambiguous in their evolutionary and functional status.
  Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic and structural analysis of FliO
  across >30,000 representative genomes spanning >100 bacterial phyla.
  Additionally, during this analysis, we found that approximately 40% of
  bacterial genomes contain flagellar genes-significantly fewer than previously
  reported. Using a custom pipeline combining low-threshold Hidden Markov models
  searches, operon context analysis, and structural information, we demonstrate
  that FliO is present in ~95% of genomes encoding the core flagellar components
  FliP, FliQ, and FliR. This suggests that FliO is a nearly ubiquitous and
  ancestral core component of the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS).
  FliO exhibits considerable structural diversity, including lineage-specific
  acquisitions of LysM and AMIN domains. We identify FliO homologs not only in
  canonical flagellar systems but also in some virulence-associated T3SS and
  even some nonflagellated organisms, suggesting functional repurposing and
  highlighting its functional plasticity. Functional studies in Campylobacter
  jejuni reveal that FliO and its AMIN domain are critical for efficient
  amphitrichous flagellation, membrane stability of the export gate component
  FlhB, and colonization of the host. These findings establish FliO as a core,
  yet evolutionarily dynamic, component of flagella and provide insights into
  the evolution and diversification of bacterial secretion systems.
