abstract: "Bacteria sense changes in their environment and transduce signals to
  adjust their cellular functions accordingly. For this purpose, bacteria employ
  various sensors feeding into multiple signal transduction pathways. Signal
  recognition by bacterial sensors is studied mainly in a few model organisms,
  but advances in genome sequencing and analysis offer new ways of exploring the
  sensory repertoire of many understudied organisms. The human gut is a natural
  target of this line of study: it is a nutrient-rich and dynamic environment
  and is home to thousands of bacterial species whose activities impact human
  health. Many gut commensals are also poorly studied compared to model
  organisms and are mainly known through their genome sequences. To begin
  exploring the signals human gut commensals sense and respond to, we have
  designed a framework that enables the identification of sensory domains,
  prediction of signals that they recognize, and experimental verification of
  these predictions. We validate this frameworkâ€™s functionality by
  systematically identifying amino acid sensors in selected bacterial genomes
  and metagenomes, characterizing their amino acid binding properties, and
  demonstrating their signal transduction potential."
