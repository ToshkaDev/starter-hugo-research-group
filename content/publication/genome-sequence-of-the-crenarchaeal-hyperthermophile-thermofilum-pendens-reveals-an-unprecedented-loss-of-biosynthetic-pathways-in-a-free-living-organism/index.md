abstract: We report the complete genome of Thermofilum pendens, a deeply
  branching, hyperthermophilic member of the order Thermoproteales in the
  archaeal kingdom Crenarchaeota. T. pendens is a sulfur-dependent, anaerobic
  heterotroph isolated from a solfatara in Iceland. It is an extracellular
  commensal, requiring an extract of Thermoproteus tenax for growth, and the
  genome sequence reveals that biosynthetic pathways for purines, most amino
  acids, and most cofactors are absent. In fact, T. pendens has fewer
  biosynthetic enzymes than obligate intracellular parasites, although it does
  not display other features that are common among obligate parasites and thus
  does not appear to be in the process of becoming a parasite. It appears that
  T. pendens has adapted to life in an environment rich in nutrients. T. pendens
  was known previously to utilize peptides as an energy source, but the genome
  revealed a substantial ability to grow on carbohydrates. T. pendens is the
  first crenarchaeote and only the second archaeon found to have a transporter
  of the phosphotransferase system. In addition to fermentation, T. pendens may
  obtain energy from sulfur reduction with hydrogen and formate as electron
  donors. It may also be capable of sulfur-independent growth on formate with
  formate hydrogen lyase. Additional novel features are the presence of a
  monomethylamine:corrinoid methyltransferase, the first time that this enzyme
  has been found outside the Methanosarcinales, and the presence of a
  presenilin-related protein. The predicted highly expressed proteins do not
  include proteins encoded by housekeeping genes and instead include ABC
  transporters for carbohydrates and peptides and clustered regularly
  interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated proteins.
