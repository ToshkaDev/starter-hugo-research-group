abstract: "Homology models of the E. coli and T. maritima chemotaxis protein
  CheW were constructed to assess the quality of structural predictions and
  their applicability in chemotaxis research: i) a model of E. coli CheW was
  constructed using the T. maritima CheW NMR structure as a template, and ii) a
  model of T. maritima CheW was constructed using the E. coli CheW NMR structure
  as a template. The conformational space accessible to the homology models and
  to the NMR structures was investigated using molecular dynamics and Monte
  Carlo simulations. The results show that even though static homology models of
  CheW may be partially structurally different from their corresponding
  experimentally determined structures, the conformational space they can access
  through their dynamic variations can be similar, for specific regions of the
  protein, to that of the experimental NMR structures. When CheW homology models
  are allowed to explore their local accessible conformational space, modeling
  can provide a rational path to predicting CheW interactions with the MCP and
  CheA proteins of the chemotaxis complex. Homology models of CheW (and
  potentially, of other chemotaxis proteins) should be seen as snapshots of an
  otherwise larger ensemble of accessible conformational space."
