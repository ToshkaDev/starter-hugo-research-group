abstract: "Chemoreceptor-based signaling pathways are among the major modes of
  bacterial signal transduction, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is an important
  model to study their function. Of the 26 chemoreceptors of this strain, PctA
  has a broad ligand range and responds to most of the proteinogenic amino
  acids, whereas PctB and PctC have a much narrower range and show strong ligand
  preference for l-glutamine and γ-aminobutyrate, respectively. Using several
  comparative genomics approaches, we show that these receptors are paralogs:
  pctA gene duplication in the common ancestor of the genus Pseudomonas led to
  pctC, whereas pctB originated through another, independent pctA duplication in
  the common ancestor of P. aeruginosa. Thus, the broad-range amino acid
  chemoreceptor was evolutionarily older, and chemoreceptors that complemented
  “missing” amino acid sensing abilities arose later in specific Pseudomonas
  lineages. Using comparative sequence analysis, newly solved crystal structures
  of PctA, PctB, and PctC ligand-binding domains, and their molecular dynamics
  simulations, we identified a conserved amino acid recognition motif and
  changes in the ligand-binding pocket that led to novel ligand specificities.
  In addition, we determined major forces driving the evolution of this group of
  chemoreceptors."
