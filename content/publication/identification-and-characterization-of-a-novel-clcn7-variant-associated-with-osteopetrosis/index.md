abstract: Osteopetrosis is a group of rare inheritable disorders of the skeleton
  characterized by increased bone density. The disease is remarkably
  heterogeneous in clinical presentation and often misdiagnosed. Therefore,
  genetic testing and molecular pathogenicity analysis are essential for precise
  diagnosis and new targets for preventive pharmacotherapy. Mutations in the
  CLCN7 gene give rise to the complete spectrum of osteopetrosis phenotypes and
  are responsible for about 75% of cases of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis. In
  this study, we report the identification of a novel variant in the CLCN7 gene
  in a patient diagnosed with osteopetrosis and provide evidence for its
  significance (likely deleterious) based on extensive comparative genomics,
  protein sequence and structure analysis. A set of automated bioinformatics
  tools used to predict consequences of this variant identified it as
  deleterious or pathogenic. Structure analysis revealed that the variant is
  located at the same “hot spot” as the most common CLCN7 mutations causing
  osteopetrosis. Deep phylogenetic reconstruction showed that not only
  Leu614Arg, but any non-aliphatic substitutions in this position are
  evolutionarily intolerant, further supporting the deleterious nature of the
  variant. The present study provides further evidence that reconstructing a
  precise evolutionary history of a gene helps in predicting phenotypical
  consequences of variants of uncertain significance.
