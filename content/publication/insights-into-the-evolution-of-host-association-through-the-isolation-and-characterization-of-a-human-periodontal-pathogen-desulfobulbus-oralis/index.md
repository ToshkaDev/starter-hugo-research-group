abstract: The human oral microbiota encompasses representatives of many
  bacterial lineages that have not yet been cultured. Here we describe the
  isolation and characterization of previously uncultured Desulfobulbus oralis,
  the first human-associated representative of its genus. As
  mammalian-associated microbes rarely have free-living close relatives, D.
  oralis provides opportunities to study how bacteria adapt and evolve within a
  host. This sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterium has adapted to the human oral
  subgingival niche by curtailing its physiological repertoire, losing some
  biosynthetic abilities and metabolic independence, and by dramatically
  reducing environmental sensing and signaling capabilities. The genes that
  enable free-living Desulfobulbus to synthesize the potent neurotoxin
  methylmercury were also lost by D. oralis, a notably positive outcome of host
  association. However, horizontal gene acquisitions from other members of the
  microbiota provided novel mechanisms of interaction with the human host,
  including toxins like leukotoxin and hemolysins. Proteomic and transcriptomic
  analysis revealed that most of those factors are actively expressed, including
  in the subgingival environment, and some are secreted. Similar to other known
  oral pathobionts, D. oralis can trigger a proinflammatory response in oral
  epithelial cells, suggesting a direct role in the development of periodontal
  disease.
