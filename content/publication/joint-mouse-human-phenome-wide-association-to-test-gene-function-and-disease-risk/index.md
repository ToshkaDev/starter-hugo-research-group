abstract: Phenome-wide association is a novel reverse genetic strategy to
  analyze genome-to-phenome relations in human clinical cohorts. Here we test
  this approach using a large murine population segregating for ∼5 million
  sequence variants, and we compare our results to those extracted from a
  matched analysis of gene variants in a large human cohort. For the mouse
  cohort, we amassed a deep and broad open-access phenome consisting of ∼4,500
  metabolic, physiological, pharmacological and behavioural traits, and more
  than 90 independent expression quantitative trait locus (QTL), transcriptome,
  proteome, metagenome and metabolome data sets—by far the largest coherent
  phenome for any experimental cohort (www.genenetwork.org). We tested
  downstream effects of subsets of variants and discovered several novel
  associations, including a missense mutation in fumarate hydratase that
  controls variation in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in both
  mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans, and missense mutations in Col6a5 that
  underlies variation in bone mineral density in both mouse and human.
