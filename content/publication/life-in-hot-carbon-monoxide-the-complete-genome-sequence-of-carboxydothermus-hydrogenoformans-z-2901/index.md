abstract: We report here the sequencing and analysis of the genome of the
  thermophilic bacterium Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z-2901. This species
  is a model for studies of hydrogenogens, which are diverse bacteria and
  archaea that grow anaerobically utilizing carbon monoxide (CO) as their sole
  carbon source and water as an electron acceptor, producing carbon dioxide and
  hydrogen as waste products. Organisms that make use of CO do so through carbon
  monoxide dehydrogenase complexes. Remarkably, analysis of the genome of C.
  hydrogenoformans reveals the presence of at least five highly differentiated
  anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase complexes, which may in part explain
  how this species is able to grow so much more rapidly on CO than many other
  species. Analysis of the genome also has provided many general insights into
  the metabolism of this organism which should make it easier to use it as a
  source of biologically produced hydrogen gas. One surprising finding is the
  presence of many genes previously found only in sporulating species in the
  Firmicutes Phylum. Although this species is also a Firmicutes, it was not
  known to sporulate previously. Here we show that it does sporulate and because
  it is missing many of the genes involved in sporulation in other species, this
  organism may serve as a “minimal” model for sporulation studies. In addition,
  using phylogenetic profile analysis, we have identified many uncharacterized
  gene families found in all known sporulating Firmicutes, but not in any
  non-sporulating bacteria, including a sigma factor not known to be involved in
  sporulation previously.
