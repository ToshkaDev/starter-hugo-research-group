abstract: Laccase, a p-diphenol oxidase typical of plants and fungi, has been
  found recently in a proteobacterium, Azospirillum lipoferum. Laccase activity
  was detected in both a natural isolate and an in vitro-obtained phase variant
  that originated from the laccase-negative wild type. In this study, the
  electron transport systems of the laccase-positive variant and its parental
  laccase-negative forms were compared. During exponential (but not stationary)
  growth under fully aerobic (but not under microaerobic) conditions, the
  laccase-positive variant lost a respiratory branch that is terminated in a
  cytochrome c oxidase of theaa3 type; this was most likely due to a defect in
  the biosynthesis of a heme component essential for the oxidase. The
  laccase-positive variant was significantly less sensitive to the inhibitory
  action of quinone analogs and fully resistant to inhibitors of the bc1
  complex, apparently due to the rearrangements of its respiratory system. We
  propose that the loss of the cytochrome c oxidase-containing branch in the
  variant is an adaptive strategy to the presence of intracellular oxidized
  quinones, the products of laccase activity.
