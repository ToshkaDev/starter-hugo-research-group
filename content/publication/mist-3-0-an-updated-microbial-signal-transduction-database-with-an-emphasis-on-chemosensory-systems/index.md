abstract: Bacteria and archaea employ dedicated signal transduction systems that
  modulate gene expression, second-messenger turnover, quorum sensing, biofilm
  formation, motility, host-pathogen and beneficial interactions. The updated
  MiST database provides a comprehensive classification of microbial signal
  transduction systems. This update is a result of a substantial scaling to
  accommodate constantly growing microbial genomic data. More than 125 000
  genomes, 516 million genes and almost 100 million unique protein sequences are
  currently stored in the database. For each bacterial and archaeal genome, MiST
  3.0 provides a complete signal transduction profile, thus facilitating
  theoretical and experimental studies on signal transduction and gene
  regulation. New software infrastructure and distributed pipeline implemented
  in MiST 3.0 enable regular genome updates based on the NCBI RefSeq database. A
  novel MiST feature is the integration of unique profile HMMs to link complex
  chemosensory systems with corresponding chemoreceptors in bacterial and
  archaeal genomes. The data can be explored online or via RESTful API (freely
  available at https://mistdb.com).
