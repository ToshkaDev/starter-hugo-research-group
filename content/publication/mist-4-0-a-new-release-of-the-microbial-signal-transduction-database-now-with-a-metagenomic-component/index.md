abstract: Signal transduction systems in bacteria and archaea link environmental
  stimuli to specific adaptive cellular responses. They control gene expression,
  motility, biofilm formation, development and other processes that are vital to
  survival. The microbial signal transduction (MiST) database is an online
  resource that stores tens of thousands of genomes and allows users to explore
  their signal transduction profiles, analyze genomes in bulk using the database
  application programming interface (API) and make testable hypotheses about the
  functions of newly identified signaling systems. However, signal transduction
  in metagenomes remained completely unexplored. To lay the foundation for
  research in metagenomic signal transduction, we have prepared a new release of
  the MiST database, MiST 4.0, which features over 10 000 metagenome-assembled
  genomes (MAGs), a scaled representation of proteins and detailed BioSample
  information. In addition, several thousands of new genomes have been processed
  and stored in the database. A new interface has been developed that allows
  users to seamlessly switch between genomes and MAGs. MiST 4.0 is freely
  available at https://mistdb.com; metagenomes and MAGs can also be explored
  using the API available on the same page.
