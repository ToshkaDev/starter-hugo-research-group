abstract: "Aerotaxis is a particular form of “energy taxis”. It is based on a
  largely elusive signal transduction machinery. In aerotaxis, oxygen dissolved
  in water plays the role of both attractant (at moderate concentrations) and
  repellent (at high and low concentrations). Cells swimming from favorable
  oxygen concentrations into regions with unfavorable concentrations increase
  the frequency of reversals, turn back into the favorable domain, and become
  effectively trapped there. At the same time, bacteria consume oxygen, creating
  an oxygen gradient. This behavior leads to a pattern formation phenomenon:
  bacteria self-organize into a dense band at a certain distance from the
  air-water interface. We incorporate experimental observations of the
  aerotactic bacterium, Azospirillum brasilense, into a mathematical model. The
  model consists of a system of differential equations describing swimming
  bacterial cells and diffusing oxygen. The cells’ frequency of reversals
  depends on the concentration of oxygen and its time derivative while oxygen is
  depleted by the bacteria. We suggest a hypothetical model of energy sensing
  mediated by aerotactic receptors Aer and Tsr. Computer simulations and
  analysis of the model equations allow comparisons of theoretical and
  experimental results and provide insight into the mechanisms of bacterial
  pattern formation and underlying signal transduction machinery. We make
  testable predictions about position and density of the bacterial band."
