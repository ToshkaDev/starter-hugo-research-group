abstract: Components of the chemotaxis system encoded in multiple heomologous
  operons were identified in five cyanobacterial genomes. Analysis of
  phylogenetic profiles, genomic context, domain architectures and sequence
  identity reveal that sensory modules of chemoreceptors that detect
  environmental cues are the subject of frequent domain birth and death events
  and have accelerated rates of sequence evolution. This fact could explain a
  remarkable diversity of the sensing repertoire of chemotaxis receptors in
  microorganisms.
