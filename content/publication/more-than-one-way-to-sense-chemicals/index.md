abstract: Sensing various chemicals in the environment and responding to changes
  in their concentrations is a fundamental property of a living cell. It is
  especially important for unicellular organisms that constantly interact with
  the environment. Microorganisms possess simple yet effective systems that
  allow them to regulate numerous cellular functions in response to changes in
  their surroundings (for recent reviews, see references (34 and54). Active
  motility of microbial cells along chemical gradients, usually referred to as
  chemotaxis, is controlled by probably the best-studied signal transduction
  system. Taxis responses allow motile microorganisms to rapidly move toward a
  microenvironment optimal for their growth and survival. The mechanism of
  flagellar motility and its control via chemotaxis have been studied in great
  detail inEscherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (for
  reviews, see references (8, 15, 55, and56). Enteric bacteria measure
  concentrations of chemicals outside the cell using transmembrane receptors
  (chemotaxis transducers) that transmit information into the cell interior.
  Transmembrane chemoreceptors are arranged into arrays, resulting in the sensor
  system, which is extremely sensitive to subtle conformational changes (14,
  55). The transmembrane signaling in E. coli is a current paradigm for chemical
  sensing (for a recent review, see reference (21). However, there is a growing
  evidence that transmembrane signaling is not the only way to sense chemicals.
  This minireview focuses on alternative strategies used by microorganisms in
  order to monitor the chemical composition of the environment.
