abstract: "Observations of free-swimming and antibody-tethered Azospirillum
  brasilense cells showed that their polar flagella could rotate in both
  clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Rotation in a counterclockwise
  direction caused forward movement of free-swimming cells, whereas the
  occasional change in the direction of rotation to clockwise caused a brief
  reversal in swimming direction. The addition of a metabolizable
  chemoattractant, e.g., malate or proline, had two distinct effects on the
  swimming behavior of the bacteria: (i) a short-term decrease in reversal
  frequency from 0.33 to 0.17 s-1 and (ii) a long-term increase in the mean
  population swimming speed from 13 to 23 microns s-1. A. brasilense therefore
  shows both chemotaxis and chemokinesis in response to temporal gradients of
  some chemoeffectors. Chemokinesis was dependent on the growth state of the
  cells and may depend on an increase in the electrochemical proton gradient
  above a saturation threshold. Analysis of behavior of a methionine auxotroph,
  assays of in vivo methylation, and the use of specific antibodies raised
  against the sensory transducer protein Tar of Escherichia coli all failed to
  demonstrate the methylation-dependent pathway for chemotaxis in A. brasilense.
  The range of chemicals to which A. brasilense shows chemotaxis and the lack of
  true repellents indicate an alternative chemosensory pathway probably based on
  metabolism of chemoeffectors."
