  Two-component systems that link environmental signals to cellular responses
  are viewed as the primary mode of signal transduction in prokaryotes. By
  analyzing information encoded by 145 prokaryotic genomes, we found that the
  majority of signal transduction systems consist of a single protein that
  contains input and output domains but lacks phosphotransfer domains typical of
  two-component systems. One-component systems are evolutionarily older, more
  widely distributed among bacteria and archaea, and display a greater diversity
  of domains than two-component systems.

  caption: "Two-component and one-component signal transduction. (a) A
    prototypical two-component signal transduction system contains input
    (colored red) and output (colored yellow) domains in two different proteins
    that communicate via a His-Asp phosphotransfer. A one-component system is a
    protein that contains input and output domains but lacks His-Asp
    phosphotransfer domains (colored grey and white). (b) Examples of
    two-component and one-component systems that use the same type of input and
    output domains. Experimentally studied proteins are identified by name,
    whereas proteins predicted from genome sequences are identified by their
