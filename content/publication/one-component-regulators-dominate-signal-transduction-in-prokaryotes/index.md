  Two-component systems that link environmental signals to cellular responses
  are viewed as the primary mode of signal transduction in prokaryotes. By
  analyzing information encoded by 145 prokaryotic genomes, we found that the
  majority of signal transduction systems consist of a single protein that
  contains input and output domains but lacks phosphotransfer domains typical of
  two-component systems. One-component systems are evolutionarily older, more
  widely distributed among bacteria and archaea, and display a greater diversity
  of domains than two-component systems.
