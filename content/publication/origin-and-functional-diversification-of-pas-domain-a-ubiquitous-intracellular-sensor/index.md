abstract: Signal perception is a key function in regulating biological
  activities and adapting to changing environments. Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains
  are ubiquitous sensors found in diverse receptors in bacteria, archaea, and
  eukaryotes, but their origins, distribution across the tree of life, and
  extent of their functional diversity are not fully characterized. Here, we
  show that using sequence conservation and structural information, it is
  possible to propose specific and potential functions for a large portion of
  nearly 3 million PAS domains. Our analysis suggests that PAS domains
  originated in bacteria and were horizontally transferred to archaea and
  eukaryotes. We reveal that gas sensing via a heme cofactor evolved
  independently in several lineages, whereas redox and light sensing via flavin
  adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide cofactors have the same origin.
  The close relatedness of human PAS domains to those in bacteria provides an
  opportunity for drug design by exploring potential natural ligands and
  cofactors for bacterial homologs.
