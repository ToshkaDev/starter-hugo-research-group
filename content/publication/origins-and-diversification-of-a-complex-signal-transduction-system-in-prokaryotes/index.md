abstract: The molecular machinery that controls chemotaxis in bacteria is
  substantially more complex than any other signal transduction system in
  prokaryotes, and its origins and variability among living species are unknown.
  We found that this multiprotein “chemotaxis system” is present in most
  prokaryotic species and evolved from simpler two-component regulatory systems
  that control prokaryotic transcription. We discovered, through genomic
  analysis, signaling systems intermediate between two-component systems and
  chemotaxis systems. Evolutionary genomics established central and auxiliary
  components of the chemotaxis system. While tracing its evolutionary history,
  we also developed a classification scheme that revealed more than a dozen
  distinct classes of chemotaxis systems, enabling future predictive modeling of
  chemotactic behavior in unstudied species.
