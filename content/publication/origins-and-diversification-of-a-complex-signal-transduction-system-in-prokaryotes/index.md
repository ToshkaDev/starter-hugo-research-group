abstract: The molecular machinery that controls chemotaxis in bacteria is
  substantially more complex than any other signal transduction system in
  prokaryotes, and its origins and variability among living species are unknown.
  We found that this multiprotein “chemotaxis system” is present in most
  prokaryotic species and evolved from simpler two-component regulatory systems
  that control prokaryotic transcription. We discovered, through genomic
  analysis, signaling systems intermediate between two-component systems and
  chemotaxis systems. Evolutionary genomics established central and auxiliary
  components of the chemotaxis system. While tracing its evolutionary history,
  we also developed a classification scheme that revealed more than a dozen
  distinct classes of chemotaxis systems, enabling future predictive modeling of
  chemotactic behavior in unstudied species.

  caption: "Phylogenomic classification of the chemotaxis system. (A) A maximum
    likelihood phylogenetic tree built from concatenated multiple sequence
    alignment of CheA-CheB-CheR proteins is shown in the middle. Branches
    corresponding to proteins that have been experimentally shown to control
    flagellar motility are in black, Tfp motility are in blue, and alternative
    cellular functions are in green (table S1). The colorful wide concentric
    circle around the tree shows the gene neighborhood for genes corresponding
    to the CheA, CheB, and CheR protein sequences on the tree. Each gene is
    shown as a small colored rectangle. The color scheme is the same as in Fig.
    1. Background color highlights 18 classes of the chemotaxis system: ACF,
    green; Tfp, blue; and 16 Fla classes, light and dark gray. The F14 class is
    not represented because it lacks CheB and CheR. (B) Protein interaction
    networks reconstructed for all 19 classes of the chemotaxis system. Color
    code is the same as in (A). F10* represents F10, F11, F13, and F16
    interaction networks. Components with outlines and interaction lines shown
    in light gray are not common to all members of a class."
