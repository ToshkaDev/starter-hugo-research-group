abstract: The microaerophilic nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense
  formed a sharply defined band in a spatial gradient of oxygen. As a result of
  aerotaxis, the bacteria were attracted to a specific low concentration of
  oxygen (3 to 5 microM). Bacteria swimming away from the aerotactic band were
  repelled by the higher or lower concentration of oxygen that they encountered
  and returned to the band. This behavior was confirmed by using temporal
  gradients of oxygen. The cellular energy level in A. brasilense, monitored by
  measuring the proton motive force, was maximal at 3 to 5 microM oxygen. The
  proton motive force was lower at oxygen concentrations that were higher or
  lower than the preferred oxygen concentration. Bacteria swimming toward the
  aerotactic band would experience an increase in the proton motive force, and
  bacteria swimming away from the band would experience a decrease in the proton
  motive force. It is proposed that the change in the proton motive force is the
  signal that regulates positive and negative aerotaxis. The preferred oxygen
  concentration for aerotaxis was similar to the preferred oxygen concentration
  for nitrogen fixation. Aerotaxis is an important adaptive behavioral response
  that can guide these free-living diazotrophs to the optimal niche for nitrogen
  fixation in the rhizosphere.
