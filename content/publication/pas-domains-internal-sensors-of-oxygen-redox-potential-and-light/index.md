abstract: PAS domains are newly recognized signaling domains that are widely
  distributed in proteins from members of the Archaea and Bacteria and from
  fungi, plants, insects, and vertebrates. They function as input modules in
  proteins that sense oxygen, redox potential, light, and some other stimuli.
  Specificity in sensing arises, in part, from different cofactors that may be
  associated with the PAS fold. Transduction of redox signals may be a common
  mechanistic theme in many different PAS domains. PAS proteins are always
  located intracellularly but may monitor the external as well as the internal
  environment. One way in which prokaryotic PAS proteins sense the environment
  is by detecting changes in the electron transport system. This serves as an
  early warning system for any reduction in cellular energy levels. Human PAS
  proteins include hypoxia-inducible factors and voltage-sensitive ion channels;
  other PAS proteins are integral components of circadian clocks. Although PAS
  domains were only recently identified, the signaling functions with which they
  are associated have long been recognized as fundamental properties of living
  cells.
