abstract: Photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is a model photoreceptor. It binds a
  p-coumaric acid as a chromophore, thus enabling blue light sensing. The first
  discovered single-domain PYP from Halorhodospira halophila has been studied
  thoroughly in terms of its structural dynamics and photochemical properties.
  However, the evolutionary origins and biological role of PYP homologs are not
  well understood. Here, we show that PYP is an evolutionarily novel domain
  family of the ubiquitous PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) superfamily. It likely originated
  from the phylum Myxococcota and was then horizontally transferred to
  representatives of a few other bacterial phyla. We show that PYP is associated
  with signal transduction either by domain fusion or by genome context. Key
  cellular functions modulated by PYP-initiated signal transduction pathways
  likely involve gene expression, motility, and biofilm formation. We identified
  three clades of the PYP family, one of which is poorly understood and
  potentially has novel functional properties. The Tyr42, Glu46, and Cys69
  residues that are involved in p-coumaric acid binding in the model PYP from H.
  halophila are well conserved in the PYP family. However, we also identified
  cases where substitutions in these residues might have led to
  neofunctionalization, such as the proposed transition from light to redox
  sensing. Overall, this study provides definition, a newly built hidden Markov
  model, and the current genomic landscape of the PYP family and sets the stage
  for the future exploration of its signaling mechanisms and functional
  diversity.
