abstract: "Maintaining cell envelope integrity is of vital importance for all
  microorganisms. Not surprisingly, evolution has shaped conserved protein
  protection networks that connect stress perception, transmembrane signal
  transduction, and mediation of cellular responses upon cell envelope stress.
  The phage shock protein (Psp) stress response is one such conserved protection
  network. Most knowledge about the Psp response derives from studies in the
  Gram-negative model bacterium Escherichia coli, where the Psp system consists
  of several well-defined protein components. Homologous systems were identified
  in representatives of the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes.
  However, the Psp system distribution in the microbial world remains largely
  unknown. By carrying out a large-scale, unbiased comparative genomics
  analysis, we found components of the Psp system in many bacterial and archaeal
  phyla and describe that the predicted Psp systems deviate dramatically from
  the known prototypes. The core proteins PspA and PspC have been integrated
  into various (often phylum-specifically) conserved protein networks during
  evolution. Based on protein domain-based and gene neighborhood analyses of
  pspA and pspC homologs, we built a natural classification system for Psp
  networks in bacteria and archaea. We validate our approach by performing a
  comprehensive in vivo protein interaction study of Psp domains identified in
  the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis and found a strong
  interconnected protein network. Our study highlights the diversity of Psp
  domain organizations and potentially diverse functions across the plethora of
  the microbial landscape, thus laying the ground for studies beyond known Psp
  functions in underrepresented organisms. "
