abstract: Identifying chemoreceptors in sequenced bacterial genomes, revealing
  their domain architecture, inferring their evolutionary relationships, and
  comparing them to chemoreceptors of known function become important steps in
  genome annotation and chemotaxis research. Here, we describe bioinformatics
  procedures that enable such analyses, using two closely related bacterial
  genomes as examples.
