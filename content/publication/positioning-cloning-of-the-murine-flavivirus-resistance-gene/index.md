abstract: Inbred mouse strains exhibit significant differences in their
  susceptibility to viruses in the genus Flavivirus, which includes human
  pathogens such as yellow fever, Dengue, and West Nile virus. A single gene,
  designated Flv, confers this differential susceptibility and was mapped
  previously to a region of mouse chromosome 5. A positional cloning strategy
  was used to identify 22 genes from the Flv gene interval including 10 members
  of the 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase gene family. One 2′-5′-oligoadenylate
  synthetase gene, Oas1b, was identified as Flv by correlation between genotype
  and phenotype in nine mouse strains. Susceptible mouse strains produce a
  protein lacking 30% of the C-terminal sequence as compared with the resistant
  counterpart because of the presence of a premature stop codon. The Oas1b gene
  differs from all the other murine Oas genes by a unique four-amino acid
  deletion in the P-loop located within the conserved RNA binding domain.
  Expression of the resistant allele of Oas1b in susceptible embryo fibroblasts
  resulted in partial inhibition of the replication of a flavivirus but not of
  an alpha togavirus.
