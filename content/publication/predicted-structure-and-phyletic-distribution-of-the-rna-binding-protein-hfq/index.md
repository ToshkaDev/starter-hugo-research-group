abstract: Hfq, a bacterial RNA-binding protein, was recently shown to contain
  the Sm1 motif, a characteristic of Sm and LSm proteins that function in RNA
  processing events in archaea and eukaryotes. In this report, comparative
  structural modeling was used to predict a three-dimensional structure of the
  Hfq core sequence. The predicted structure aligns with most major features of
  the Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum LSm protein structure. Conserved
  residues in Hfq are positioned at the same structural locations responsible
  for subunit assembly and RNA interaction in Sm proteins. A highly conserved
  portion of Hfq assumes a structural fold similar to the Sm2 motif of Sm
  proteins. The evolution of the Hfq protein was explored by conducting a BLAST
  search of microbial genomes followed by phylogenetic analysis. Approximately
  half of the 140 complete or nearly complete genomes examined contain at least
  one gene coding for Hfq. The presence or absence of Hfq closely followed major
  bacterial clades. It is absent from high-level clades and present in the
  ancient Thermotogales-Aquificales clade and all proteobacteria except for
  those that have undergone major reduction in genome size. Residues at three
  positions in Hfq form signatures for the beta/gamma proteobacteria, alpha
  proteobacteria and low GC Gram-positive bacteria groups.
