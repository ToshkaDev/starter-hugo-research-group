abstract: Chemoreceptors in bacteria detect a variety of signals and feed this
  information into chemosensory pathways that represent a major mode of signal
  transduction. The five chemoreceptors from Escherichia coli have served as
  traditional models in the study of this protein family. Genome analyses
  revealed that many bacteria contain much larger numbers of chemoreceptors with
  broader sensory capabilities. Chemoreceptors differ in topology, sensing mode,
  cellular location, and, above all, the type of ligand binding domain (LBD).
  Here, we highlight LBD diversity using well-established and emerging model
  organisms as well as genomic surveys. Nearly a hundred different types of
  protein domains that are found in chemoreceptor sequences are known or
  predicted LBDs, but only a few of them are ubiquitous. LBDs of the same class
  recognize different ligands, and conversely, the same ligand can be recognized
  by structurally different LBDs; however, recent studies began to reveal common
  characteristics in signal-LBD relationships. Although signals can stimulate
  chemoreceptors in a variety of different ways, diverse LBDs appear to employ a
  universal transmembrane signaling mechanism. Current and future studies aim to
  establish relationships between LBD types, the nature of signals that they
  recognize, and the mechanisms of signal recognition and transduction.
