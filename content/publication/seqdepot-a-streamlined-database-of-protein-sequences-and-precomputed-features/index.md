  Summary: Assembling and/or producing integrated knowledge of sequence features
  continues to be an onerous and redundant task despite a large number of
  existing resources. We have developed SeqDepotâ€”a novel database that focuses
  solely on two primary goals: (i) assimilating known primary sequences with
  predicted feature data and (ii) providing the most simple and straightforward
  means to procure and readily use this information. Access to >28.5 million
  sequences and 300 million features is provided through a well-documented and
  flexible RESTful interface that supports fetching specific data subsets, bulk
  queries, visualization and searching by MD5 digests or external database
  identifiers. We have also developed an HTML5/JavaScript web application
  exemplifying how to interact with SeqDepot and Perl/Python scripts for use
  with local processing pipelines.


  Availability: Freely available on the web at http://seqdepot.net/. REST access via http://seqdepot.net/api/v1. Database files and scripts may be downloaded from http://seqdepot.net/download.
