abstract: Currently, the cost of cellulase enzymes remains a key economic
  impediment to commercialization of biofuels (1.). Enzymes from glycoside
  hydrolase family 48 (GH48) are a critical component of numerous natural
  lignocellulose-degrading systems. Although computational mining of large
  genomic data sets is a promising new approach for identifying novel
  cellulolytic activities, current computational methods are unable to
  distinguish between cellulases and enzymes with different substrate
  specificities that belong to the same protein family. We show that by using a
  robust computational approach supported by experimental studies, cellulases
  and non-cellulases can be effectively identified within a given protein
  family. Phylogenetic analysis of GH48 showed non-monophyletic distribution, an
  indication of horizontal gene transfer. Enzymatic function of GH48 proteins
  coded by horizontally transferred genes was verified experimentally, which
  confirmed that these proteins are cellulases. Computational and structural
  studies of GH48 enzymes identified structural elements that define cellulases
  and can be used to computationally distinguish them from non-cellulases. We
  propose that the structural element that can be used for in silico
  discrimination between cellulases and non-cellulases belonging to GH48 is an
  ω-loop located on the surface of the molecule and characterized by highly
  conserved rare amino acids. These markers were used to screen metagenomics
  data for “true” cellulases.
