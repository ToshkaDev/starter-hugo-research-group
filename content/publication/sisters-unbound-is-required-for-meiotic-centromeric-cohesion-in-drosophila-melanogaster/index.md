abstract: Regular meiotic chromosome segregation requires sister centromeres to
  mono-orient (orient to the same pole) during the first meiotic division
  (meiosis I) when homologous chromosomes segregate, and to bi-orient (orient to
  opposite poles) during the second meiotic division (meiosis II) when sister
  chromatids segregate. Both orientation patterns require cohesion between
  sister centromeres, which is established during meiotic DNA replication and
  persists until anaphase of meiosis II. Meiotic cohesion is mediated by a
  conserved four-protein complex called cohesin that includes two structural
  maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) subunits (SMC1 and SMC3) and two non-SMC
  subunits. In Drosophila melanogaster, however, the meiotic cohesion apparatus
  has not been fully characterized and the non-SMC subunits have not been
  identified. We have identified a novel Drosophila gene called sisters unbound
  (sunn), which is required for stable sister chromatid cohesion throughout
  meiosis. sunn mutations disrupt centromere cohesion during prophase I and
  cause high frequencies of non-disjunction (NDJ) at both meiotic divisions in
  both sexes. SUNN co-localizes at centromeres with the cohesion proteins SMC1
  and SOLO in both sexes and is necessary for the recruitment of both proteins
  to centromeres. Although SUNN lacks sequence homology to cohesins,
  bioinformatic analysis indicates that SUNN may be a structural homolog of the
  non-SMC cohesin subunit stromalin (SA), suggesting that SUNN may serve as a
  meiosis-specific cohesin subunit. In conclusion, our data show that SUNN is an
  essential meiosis-specific Drosophila cohesion protein.
