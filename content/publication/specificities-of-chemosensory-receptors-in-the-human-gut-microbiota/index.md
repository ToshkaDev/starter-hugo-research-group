abstract: "The human gut is rich in metabolites and harbors a complex microbial
  community, yet surprisingly little is known about the spectrum of chemical
  signals detected by the large variety of sensory receptors present in the gut
  microbiome. Here, we systematically mapped the ligand specificities of
  selected extracytoplasmic sensory domains from twenty members of the human gut
  microbiota, with a primary focus on the abundant and physiologically important
  class of Clostridia. Twenty-five metabolites from different chemical
  classes-including amino acids, nucleobase derivatives, amines, indole, and
  carboxylates-were identified as specific ligands for fifteen sensory domains
  from nine bacterial species, which represent all three major functional
  classes of transmembrane receptors: chemotaxis receptors, histidine kinases,
  and enzymatic sensors. We have further characterized the specificity and
  evolution of ligand binding to Cache superfamily sensors specific for lactate,
  dicarboxylic acids, and for uracil and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).
  Structural and biochemical analysis of the dCache sensor of uracil and SCFAs
  revealed that its two different ligand types bind at distinct sensory modules.
  Overall, combining experimental identification with computational analyses, we
  were able to assign ligands to approximately half of the Cache-type chemotaxis
  receptors found in the eleven gut commensal genomes from our set, with
  carboxylic acids representing the largest ligand class. Among these, the most
  commonly found ligand specificities were for lactate and formate, indicating a
  particular importance of these metabolites in the human gut microbiota and
  consistent with their observed growth-promoting effects on selected bacterial
  commensals."
