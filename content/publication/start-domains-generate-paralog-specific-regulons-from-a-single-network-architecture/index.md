abstract: Functional divergence of transcription factors (TFs) has driven
  cellular and organismal complexity throughout evolution, but its mechanistic
  drivers remain poorly understood. Here we test for new mechanisms using CORONA
  (CNA) and PHABULOSA (PHB), two functionally diverged paralogs in the CLASS III
  HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIPIII) family of TFs. We show that virtually
  all genes bound by PHB ( ~ 99%) are also bound by CNA, ruling out occupation
  of distinct sets of genes as a mechanism of functional divergence. Further,
  genes bound and regulated by both paralogs are almost always regulated in the
  same direction, ruling out opposite regulation of shared targets as a
  mechanistic driver. Functional divergence of CNA and PHB instead results from
  differential usage of shared binding sites, with hundreds of uniquely
  regulated genes emerging from a commonly bound genetic network. Regulation of
  a given gene by CNA or PHB is thus a function of whether a bound site is
  considered ‘responsive’ versus ‘non-responsive’ by each paralog.
  Discrimination between responsive and non-responsive sites is controlled, at
  least in part, by their lipid binding START domain. This suggests a model in
  which HD-ZIPIII TFs use information integrated by their START domain to
  generate paralog-specific transcriptional outcomes from a shared network
  architecture. Taken together, our study identifies a mechanism of HD-ZIPIII TF
  paralog divergence and proposes the ubiquitously distributed START
  evolutionary module as a driver of functional divergence.
