abstract: The ability of bacteria to adapt to changing environmental conditions
  largely depends on transmembrane receptors that sense signal molecules and
  generate responses such as chemotaxis, changes in gene expression, or
  alterations in second-messenger levels. Although these receptors differ
  significantly in function, they share a common mode of activation that
  involves signal molecule interaction with sensor domains. A major challenge in
  microbiology lies in the limited knowledge of ligands that stimulate
  receptors. Here, we review recent advances in this field, including the
  occurrence of multi-modular sensor domains, the identification of co-component
  signal transduction systems, evidence for sensor domain evolution from
  transporters, and the use of binding pocket sequence motifs to identify sensor
  domain ligands.
