abstract: "Bacterial chemosensory arrays are composed of extended networks of
  chemoreceptors (also known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, MCPs), the
  histidine kinase CheA, and the adaptor protein CheW. Models of these arrays
  have been developed from cryoelectron microscopy, crystal structures of binary
  and ternary complexes, NMR spectroscopy, mutational, data and biochemical
  studies. A new 3.2 Å resolution crystal structure of a Thermotoga maritima MCP
  protein interaction region in complex with the CheA kinase-regulatory module
  (P4–P5) and adaptor protein CheW provides sufficient detail to define residue
  contacts at the interfaces formed among the three proteins. As in a previous
  4.5 Å resolution structure, CheA-P5 and CheW interact through conserved
  hydrophobic surfaces at the ends of their β-barrels to form pseudo 6-fold
  symmetric rings in which the two proteins alternate around the circumference.
  The interface between P5 subdomain 1 and CheW subdomain 2 was anticipated from
  previous studies, whereas the related interface between CheW subdomain 1 and
  P5 subdomain 2 has only been observed in these ring assemblies. The receptor
  forms an unexpected structure in that the helical hairpin tip of each subunit
  has “unzipped” into a continuous α-helix; four such helices associate into a
  bundle, and the tetramers bridge adjacent P5-CheW rings in the lattice through
  interactions with both P5 and CheW. P5 and CheW each bind a receptor helix
  with a groove of conserved hydrophobic residues between subdomains 1 and 2. P5
  binds the receptor helix N-terminal to the tip region (lower site), whereas
  CheW binds the same helix with inverted polarity near the bundle end (upper
  site). Sequence comparisons among different evolutionary classes of chemotaxis
  proteins show that the binding partners undergo correlated changes at key
  residue positions that involve the lower site. Such evolutionary analyses
  argue that both CheW and P5 bind to the receptor tip at overlapping positions.
  Computational genomics further reveal that two distinct CheW proteins in
  Thermotogae utilize the analogous recognition motifs to couple different
  receptor classes to the same CheA kinase. Important residues for function
  previously identified by mutagenesis, chemical modification and biophysical
  approaches also map to these same interfaces. Thus, although the native
  CheW–receptor interaction is not observed in the present crystal structure,
  the bioinformatics and previous data predict key features of this interface.
  The companion study of the P5-receptor interface in native arrays
  (accompanying paper Piasta et al. (2013) Biochemistry, DOI: 10.1021/bi400385c)
  shows that, despite the non-native receptor fold in the present crystal
  structure, the local helix-in-groove contacts of the crystallographic
  P5-receptor interaction are present in native arrays and are essential for
  receptor regulation of kinase activity."
