abstract: Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are nearly ubiquitous
  across bacterial species and enable bacteria to sense and respond to specific
  cues for environmental adaptation. The Campylobacter jejuni BumSR TCS is
  unusual in that the BumS sensor exclusively functions as a phosphatase rather
  than a kinase to control phosphorylated levels of its cognate BumR response
  regulator (P-BumR). We previously found that BumSR directs a response to the
  short-chain fatty acid butyrate generated by resident microbiota so that C.
  jejuni identifies ideal lower intestinal niches in avian and human hosts for
  colonization. However, butyrate is an indirect cue for BumS and did not
  inhibit in vitro BumS phosphatase activity for P-BumR. In this work, we
  expanded the repertoire of lower intestinal metabolites that are cues sensed
  by BumS that modulate the expression of genes required for colonization to
  include the branched short-chain fatty acids isobutyrate and isovalerate.
  Unlike butyrate, isobutyrate and isovalerate inhibited in vitro BumS
  phosphatase activity for P-BumR, indicating that these metabolites are direct
  cues for BumS. Isobutyrate and isovalerate reduced the thermostability of BumS
  and caused a reorganization of protein structure to suggest how sensing these
  cues inhibits phosphatase activity. We also identified residues in the BumS
  sensory domain required to detect isobutyrate, isovalerate, and butyrate and
  for optimal colonization of hosts to reveal how gut bacteria can recognize
  these intestinal metabolites. Our work reveals how this unusual bacterial
  sensor phosphatase senses a repertoire of intestinal metabolites and how cues
  alter BumSR signal transduction to influence C. jejuni colonization of hosts.
