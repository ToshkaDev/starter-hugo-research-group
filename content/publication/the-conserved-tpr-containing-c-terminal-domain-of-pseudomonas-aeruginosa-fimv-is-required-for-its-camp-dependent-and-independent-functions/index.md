abstract: >
  FimV is a Pseudomonas aeruginosa inner membrane protein that regulates
  intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels—and thus type IV pilus (T4P)-mediated
  twitching motility and type II secretion (T2S)—by activating the adenylate
  cyclase CyaB. Its cytoplasmic domain contains three predicted
  tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs separated by an unstructured region: two
  proximal to the inner membrane and one within the “FimV C-terminal domain,”
  which is highly conserved across diverse homologs. Here, we present the
  crystal structure of the FimV C terminus, FimV861–919, containing a TPR motif
  decorated with solvent-exposed, charged side chains, plus a C-terminal capping
  helix. FimV689, a truncated form lacking this C-terminal motif, did not
  restore wild-type levels of twitching or surface piliation compared to the
  full-length protein. FimV689 failed to restore wild-type levels of the T4P
  motor ATPase PilU or T2S, suggesting that it was unable to activate cAMP
  synthesis. Bacterial two-hybrid analysis showed that TPR3 interacts directly
  with the CyaB activator, FimL. However, FimV689 failed to restore wild-type
  motility in a fimV mutant expressing a constitutively active CyaB (fimV
  cyaB-R456L), suggesting that the C-terminal motif is also involved in
  cAMP-independent functions of FimV. The data show that the highly conserved
  TPR-containing C-terminal domain of FimV is critical for its cAMP-dependent
  and -independent functions.
