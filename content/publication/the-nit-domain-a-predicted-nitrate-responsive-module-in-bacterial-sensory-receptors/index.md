abstract: A nitrate- and nitrite-sensing (NIT) domain as found in the NasR
  protein, has been detected in various receptor components of signal
  transduction pathways in different bacterial lineages. Cellular functions
  controlled by receptors that contain this novel domain include regulation of
  gene expression (transcription anti-terminators and histidine kinases), cell
  motility (chemotaxis receptors) and enzyme activity (diguanylate cyclases and
  phosphodiesterases).
