abstract: Chemotaxis is a fundamental process whereby bacteria seek out nutrient
  sources and avoid harmful chemicals. For the symbiotic soil bacterium
  Sinorhizobium meliloti, the chemotaxis system also plays an essential role in
  the interaction with its legume host. The chemotactic signaling cascade is
  initiated through interactions of an attractant or repellent compound with
  chemoreceptors or methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). S. meliloti
  possesses eight chemoreceptors to mediate chemotaxis. Six of these receptors
  are transmembrane proteins with periplasmic ligand-binding domains (LBDs). The
  specific functions of McpW and McpZ are still unknown. Here, we report the
  crystal structure of the periplasmic domain of McpZ (McpZPD) at 2.7 Å
  resolution. McpZPD assumes a novel fold consisting of three concatenated
  four-helix bundle modules. Through phylogenetic analyses, we discovered that
  this helical tri-modular domain fold arose within the Rhizobiaceae family and
  is still evolving rapidly. The structure, offering a rare view of a
  ligand-free dimeric MCP-LBD, reveals a novel dimerization interface. Molecular
  dynamics calculations suggest ligand binding will induce conformational
  changes that result in large horizontal helix movements within the
  membrane-proximal domains of the McpZPD dimer that are accompanied by a 5 Å
  vertical shift of the terminal helix toward the inner cell membrane. These
  results suggest a mechanism of transmembrane signaling for this family of MCPs
  that entails both piston-type and scissoring movements. The predicted
  movements terminate in a conformation that closely mirrors those observed in
  related ligand-bound MCP-LBDs.
