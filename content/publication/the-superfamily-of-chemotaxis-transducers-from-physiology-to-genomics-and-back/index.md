abstract: "Chemotaxis transducers are specialized receptors that microorganisms
  use in order to sense the environment in directing their motility to favorable
  niches. The Escherichia coli transducers are models for studying the sensory
  and signaling events at the molecular level. Extensive studies in other
  organisms and the arrival of genomics has resulted in the accumulation of
  sequences of many transducer genes, but they are not fully understood. In
  silico analysis provides some assistance in classification of various
  transducers from different species and in predicting their function. All
  transducers contain two structural modules: a conserved C-terminal multidomain
  module, which is a signature element of the transducer superfamily, and a
  variable N-terminal module, which is responsible for the diversity within the
  superfamily. These structural modules have two distinct functions: the
  conserved C-terminal module is involved in signaling and adaptation, and the
  N-terminal module is involved in sensing various stimuli. Both C-terminal and
  N-terminal modules appear to be mobile genetic elements and subjects of
  duplication and lateral transfer. Although chemotaxis transducers are found
  exclusively in prokaryotic organisms that have some type of motility
  (flagellar, gliding or pili-based), several types of domains that are found in
  their N-terminal modules are also present in signal transduction proteins from
  eukaryotes, including humans. This indicates that basic principles of sensory
  transduction are conserved throughout the phylogenetic tree and that the
  chemotaxis transducer superfamily is a valuable source of novel sensory
  elements yet to be discovered."
