abstract: Amino acids are important nutrients and also serve as signals for
  diverse signal transduction pathways. Bacteria use chemoreceptors to recognize
  amino acid attractants and to navigate their gradients. In Escherichia coli
  two likely paralogous chemoreceptors Tsr and Tar detect 9 amino acids, whereas
  in Pseudomonas aeruginosa the paralogous chemoreceptors PctA, PctB and PctC
  detect 18 amino acids. Here, we show that the phytobacterium Pectobacterium
  atrosepticum uses the three non-homologous chemoreceptors PacA, PacB and PacC
  to detect 19 proteinogenic and several non-proteinogenic amino acids. PacB
  recognizes 18 proteinogenic amino acids as well as 8 non-proteinogenic amino
  acids. PacB has a ligand preference for the three branched chain amino acids
  L-leucine, L-valine and L-isoleucine. PacA detects L-proline next to several
  quaternary amines. The third chemoreceptor, PacC, is an ortholog of E. coli
  Tsr and the only one of the 36 P. atrosepticum chemoreceptors that is encoded
  in the cluster of chemosensory pathway genes. Surprisingly, in contrast to
  Tsr, which primarily senses serine, PacC recognizes aspartate as the major
  chemoeffector but not serine. Our results demonstrate that bacteria use
  various strategies to sense a wide range of amino acids and that it takes more
  than one chemoreceptor to achieve this goal.
