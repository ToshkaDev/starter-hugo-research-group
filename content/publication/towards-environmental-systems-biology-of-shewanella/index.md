abstract: Bacteria of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile
  electron-accepting capacities, which allow them to couple the decomposition of
  organic matter to the reduction of the various terminal electron acceptors
  that they encounter in their stratified environments. Owing to their diverse
  metabolic capabilities, shewanellae are important for carbon cycling and have
  considerable potential for the remediation of contaminated environments and
  use in microbial fuel cells. Systems-level analysis of the model species
  Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and other members of this genus has provided new
  insights into the signal-transduction proteins, regulators, and metabolic and
  respiratory subsystems that govern the remarkable versatility of the
  shewanellae.
