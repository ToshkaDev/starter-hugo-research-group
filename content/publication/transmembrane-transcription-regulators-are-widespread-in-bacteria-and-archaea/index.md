abstract: To adapt and proliferate, bacteria must sense and respond to the
  ever-changing environment. Transmembrane transcription regulators (TTRs) are a
  family of one-component transcription regulators that respond to extracellular
  information and influence gene expression from the cytoplasmic membrane. How
  TTRs function to modulate expression of their target genes while localized to
  the cytoplasmic membrane remains poorly understood. In part, this is due to a
  lack of knowledge regarding the prevalence of TTRs among prokaryotes. Here, we
  show that TTRs are highly diverse and prevalent throughout bacteria and
  archaea. Our work demonstrates that TTRs are more common than previously
  appreciated and are enriched within specific bacterial and archaeal phyla and
  that many TTRs have unique transmembrane region properties that can facilitate
  association with detergent-resistant membranes.
