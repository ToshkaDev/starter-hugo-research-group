abstract: Key steps in a computational study of protein function involve
  analysis of (i) relationships between homologous proteins, (ii) protein domain
  architecture and (iii) gene neighborhoods the corresponding proteins are
  encoded in. Each of these steps requires a separate computational task and
  sets of tools. Currently in order to relate protein features and gene
  neighborhoods information to phylogeny, researchers need to prepare all the
  necessary data and combine them by hand, which is time-consuming and
  error-prone. Here, we present a new platform, TREND (tree-based exploration of
  neighborhoods and domains), which can perform all the necessary steps in
  automated fashion and put the derived information into phylogenomic context,
  thus making evolutionary based protein function analysis more efficient. A
  rich set of adjustable components allows a user to run the computational steps
  specific to his task. TREND is freely available at http://trend.evobionet.com
