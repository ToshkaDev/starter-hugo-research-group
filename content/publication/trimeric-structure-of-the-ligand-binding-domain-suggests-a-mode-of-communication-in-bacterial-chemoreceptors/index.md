abstract: Transmembrane chemoreceptors are widely present in Bacteria and
  Archaea. They play a critical role in sensing various signals outside and
  transmitting to the cell interior. Here, we report the structure of the
  periplasmic ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the transmembrane chemoreceptor
  MCP2201, which governs chemotaxis to citrate and other organic compounds in
  Comamonas testosteroni. The apo-form LBD crystal revealed a typical four-helix
  bundle homodimer, similar to previously well-studied chemoreceptors such as
  Tar and Tsr of Escherichia coli. However, the citrate-bound LBD revealed a
  four-helix bundle homotrimer that had not been observed in bacterial
  chemoreceptor LBDs. This homotrimer was further confirmed with size-exclusion
  chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation and cross-linking experiments.
  The physiological importance of the homotrimer for chemotaxis was demonstrated
  with site-directed mutations of key amino acid residues in C. testosteroni
  mutants.
