  Bacterial two-component regulatory systems provide a simple stimulus-response
  coupling mechanism to enable bacteria to detect changes in environmental and
  intracellular conditions and respond accordingly by adjusting various cellular
  functions. Since their discovery in the mid-1980s, two-component systems have
  been the subject of intense investigation. More than a thousand research
  papers dealing with various aspects of two-component signaling have been
  published in the Journal of Bacteriology; thus, it felt natural to assemble
  current studies on the topic into a special issue in the journal. In addition
  to research articles contributed in response to a call for manuscripts, this
  special issue includes two minireviews that describe emerging research on
  two-component systems. One summarizes a broad spectrum of advances from the
  Bacterial Locomotion and Signal Transduction (BLAST XIV) conference held in
  January 2017 in New Orleans, LA, and the other focuses on the role of
  two-component systems in motility and the formation of biofilms. Not
  surprisingly, both the reviews and original research papers that appear in
  this issue demonstrate the depth and the breadth of modern research on
  two-component signal transduction. They showcase studies not only on histidine
  kinases and response regulators that comprise a two-component system in its
  classical definition but also on many additional elements that are integrated
  into or interface with these systems. Best-known examples include chemosensory
  pathways controlling flagellar motility and other functions that in addition
  to the CheA/CheY two-component system employ chemoreceptors, adaptors,
  phosphatases, and modifying enzymes. Functions controlled by two-component
  systems include phenomena at molecular, cellular, and population levels: gene
  expression, second-messenger turnover, swimming motility and translocation
  across surfaces, quorum sensing, biofilm production, host-pathogen as well as
  beneficial interactions, etc., many of which are documented in this issue. The
  field has evolved dramatically due to technological advances and
  interdisciplinary approaches. Studies published in this issue utilized
  cutting-edge applications in molecular genetics, biochemistry, and structural
  and cell biology, as well as biophysics and bioinformatics. Thus, we hope that
  papers published in this issue will be of interest not only to the signal
  transduction community but also to a much wider readership of the Journal of
  Bacteriology.

  We used the journal's standard procedures for accepting manuscripts for this issue, including thorough peer review of each submission.
