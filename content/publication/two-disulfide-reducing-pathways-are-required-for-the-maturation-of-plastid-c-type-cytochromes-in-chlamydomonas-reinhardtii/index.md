abstract: In plastids, conversion of light energy into ATP relies on cytochrome
  f, a key electron carrier with a heme covalently attached to a CXXCH motif.
  Covalent heme attachment requires reduction of the disulfide-bonded CXXCH by
  CCS5 and CCS4. CCS5 receives electrons from the oxidoreductase CCDA, while
  CCS4 is a protein of unknown function. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, loss of
  CCS4 or CCS5 yields a partial cytochrome f assembly defect. Here, we report
  that the ccs4ccs5 double mutant displays a synthetic photosynthetic defect
  characterized by a complete loss of holocytochrome f assembly. This defect is
  chemically corrected by reducing agents, confirming the placement of CCS4 and
  CCS5 in a reducing pathway. CCS4-like proteins occur in the green lineage, and
  we show that HCF153, a distant ortholog from Arabidopsis thaliana, can
  substitute for Chlamydomonas CCS4. Dominant suppressor mutations mapping to
  the CCS4 gene were identified in photosynthetic revertants of the ccs4ccs5
  mutants. The suppressor mutations yield changes in the stroma-facing domain of
  CCS4 that restore holocytochrome f assembly above the residual levels detected
  in ccs5. Because the CCDA protein accumulation is decreased specifically in
  the ccs4 mutant, we hypothesize the suppressor mutations enhance the supply of
  reducing power through CCDA in the absence of CCS5. We discuss the operation
  of a CCS5-dependent and a CCS5-independent pathway controlling the redox
  status of the heme-binding cysteines of apocytochrome f.
