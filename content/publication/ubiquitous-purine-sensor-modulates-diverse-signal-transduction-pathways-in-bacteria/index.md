abstract: Purines and their derivatives control intracellular energy homeostasis
  and nucleotide synthesis, and act as signaling molecules. Here, we combine
  structural and sequence information to define a purine-binding motif that is
  present in sensor domains of thousands of bacterial receptors that modulate
  motility, gene expression, metabolism, and second-messenger turnover.
  Microcalorimetric titrations of selected sensor domains validate their ability
  to specifically bind purine derivatives, and evolutionary analyses indicate
  that purine sensors share a common ancestor with amino-acid receptors.
  Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence of physiological relevance of
  purine sensing in a second-messenger signaling system that modulates c-di-GMP
  levels.
