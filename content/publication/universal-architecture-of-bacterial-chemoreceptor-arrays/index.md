abstract: Chemoreceptors are key components of the high-performance signal
  transduction system that controls bacterial chemotaxis. Chemoreceptors are
  typically localized in a cluster at the cell pole, where interactions among
  the receptors in the cluster are thought to contribute to the high
  sensitivity, wide dynamic range, and precise adaptation of the signaling
  system. Previous structural and genomic studies have produced conflicting
  models, however, for the arrangement of the chemoreceptors in the clusters.
  Using whole-cell electron cryo-tomography, here we show that chemoreceptors of
  different classes and in many different species representing several major
  bacterial phyla are all arranged into a highly conserved, 12-nm hexagonal
  array consistent with the proposed “trimer of dimers” organization. The
  various observed lengths of the receptors confirm current models for the
  methylation, flexible bundle, signaling, and linker sub-domains in vivo. Our
  results suggest that the basic mechanism and function of receptor clustering
  is universal among bacterial species and was thus conserved during evolution.
